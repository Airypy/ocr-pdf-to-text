Hello coders,

This is a mini-ocr project which extracts the text from the pdf data and outputs into seperate files.

Details:
% It extracts questions as store it in Questions.txt similarly for answers and multiple choice options.
% I have improvised the the answers.txt as it was containing less no. of answers as compared to questions and options.
% Ther are some cases where printing in wrong in PDF,but rest everything is printed from top to bottom
% New.pdf is the instance page of the working code.
