For Question 1.---------------
Explanation:

Universe

Claudius Ptolemy was the first to put
forward the geocentric view of the
Universe. He postulated that the Earth
is in the center of the universe and all the
celestial bodies are moving around it.

Nicolaus Copernicus shattered the long-
held notion that the Earth was the center of
the solar system proposing a heliocentric
(sun-centered) model instead.

In the early 1920s Edwin Hubble detected
Cepheid variables in the nearby Andromeda
galaxy and discerned that it was just under
a million light-years away. He also said
that the diameter of the universe is
5 billion light-years. Today the best
estimate is that the galaxy is actually 54
million light-years away.

For Question 3.---------------
Explanation:

Theories of Origin of Life

Six major theories are proposed to explain
the origin of life on earth. These theories
are as follows:

>» Theory of Special Creations: It
proposes that life on earth is created
by a supernatural power the GOD.
It also proposes that all the living
organisms in present form were
created the same day.

» Theory of spontaneous generations: It
assumes that non-living material in a
spontaneous manner gives rise to life.
This theory was criticized by Lazzaro
Spallanzani Francisco Redi and Louis
Pasteur.

» Theory of catastrophism: It assumes
that life is originated by the special
creation and it is followed by
catastrophe due to geographical
disturbances.

» Theory of cosmozoic: This theory was
put forward by Richter and strongly
supported by Arrhenius. The theory
assumes that life was present in the
form of resistant spores and appeared
on earth from other planets. Since the
condition of earth was supporting the
life these spores grew and evolved into
different organisms. This theory was
also known as “theory of panspermia
or spore theory”.

» The modern theory/ Chemical Theory/
Theory of primary abiogenesis: In
the modern theory the hypothesis
of abiogenesis was proposed with a
condition that the non-living materials
can give rise to life in the condition
of primitive earth. The condition of
the primitive earth is different from
the present conditions which do not
permit abiogenesis. The idea of
chemical theory was put forward
by two scientists A.I. Oparin and
J.B.S Haldane.

It has made the following assumptions:

» Spontaneous generation of life under
the present environment is not
possible.

» Earth’s atmosphere ~1 billion years
is very different from the current
conditions.

>» Primitive earth’s atmosphere was
reducing in nature.

>» Under these conditions the chemical
molecules (inorganic molecules) react
with each

>» other through a series of reactions to
form organic substances and other
complex

> biomolecules.

>» The solar energy and UV radiation
provided the energy for the chemical
reactions.

The hypothesis proposed by Haldane
didn’t find much support without scientific
experimentation. To conclusively support
the chemical theory Miller and Urey
conducted a successful experiment in
mimicking primitive earth environment.

As per the hypothesis the origin of life
have four major steps:

>» Formation of Inorganic molecules

>» Spontaneous formation of monomeric
organic compounds

>» Spontaneous formation of complex
organic compounds

» Spontaneous formation of molecular
aggregates

After this the first protocells and first cell
were formed.

For Question 7.---------------
Explanation:

Parts of Earth

The Earth consists of three parts as
follows:

>» Baryosphere: it is the central core
of the earth. It is filled with molten
magma with a large quantity of
iron and nickel. Baryosphere has


two zones: the inner core region
(~800 miles radius) and the outer
core region (~1400miles radius).

» Pyrosphere: it is the middle part of
the earth also known as mantle. It is
~1800 miles in thickness and mainly
consists of silica manganese and
magnesium.

» Lithosphere: it is the outermost region
of the earth also known as crust. It is
20-25 miles in thickness and mainly
has silica and aluminum.

Kuiper belt

It is a donut-shaped region of icy
bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.

There may be millions of these icy objects
collectively referred to as Kuiper Belt
objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects
(TNOs) in this distant region of our solar
system.

Similar to the asteroid belt the Kuiper
Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar
system’s early history. Like the asteroid
belt it has also been shaped by a giant
planet although it’s more of a thick disk
dike a donut) than a thin belt.

 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 9.---------------
Explanation:

Latitude and longitude

Thetime difference is due to the longitudinal
difference. 1 Degree = 4 minutes i.e. 15
degrees= 1 hour.

There is a difference of 120 degrees
(between 60°E and 60°W) in the longitudes
between the two places i.e. 8 hours.

Now at 60°E there is a gain of 8
hours as East is earlier to the West
(geographically).

 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 10.---------------
Explanation:

Tim zones

A time zone is a region or area that
observes the same standard time. The
world is divided longitudinally into time
zones with each hour difference roughly
15 degrees apart.

Most countries having smaller longitudinal
expanse have only one time-zone. There


are 23 countries with at least two time
zones.

The top 10 countries having the most
number of time zones are France(12)
United States(11) Russia(11) United
Kingdom(9) Australia(8) Canada(6)
Denmark(5) New Zealand (5) Brazil(4)
and Mexico(4).

Despite France and UK are small
countries they have more time zones
as they have a number of overseas
territories esp. in all three Oceans.

China despite being the third-largest
country has only one time-zone due to
its political ideology.

 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 11.---------------
Explanation:

Asteroids Comets and Meteors

Asteroids sometimes called minor planets
are rocky airless remnants left over from
the early formation of our solar system
about 6 billion years ago. Most of this
ancient space rubble can be found orbiting
the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within
the main asteroid belt.

Meteoroids are objects in space that range
in size from dust grains to small asteroids.
Think of them as “space rocks.” When
meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere
(or that of another planet like Mars) at
high speed and burn up the fireballs or
“shooting stars” are called meteors. When
a meteoroid survives a trip through
the atmosphere and hits the ground
it’s called a meteorite.

Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen
gases rock and dust that orbit the Sun.
When frozen they are the size of a small
town. When a comet’s orbit brings it close
to the Sun it heats up and spews dust and
gases into a giant glowing head larger than
most planets. The dust and gases form
a tail that stretches away from the Sun
for millions of miles. There are likely
billions of comets orbiting our Sun in
the Kuiper Belt and even more distant
Oort Cloud.

Comets and _ asteroids probably
delivered some of the water and other
ingredients that allowed the complex
chemistry of life to begin on Earth. The
amino acid glycine was discovered in
the comet dust returned to Earth by
the Stardust mission. Glycine is used
by living organisms to make proteins.
The discovery supports the theory
that some of life’s ingredients formed


in space and were delivered to Earth
long ago by meteorite and comet
impacts

The Oort Cloud is an extended shell
of icy objects that exist in the outermost
reaches of the solar system. It is named
after astronomer Jan Oort who first
theorized its existence.

 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 12.---------------
Explanation:

Solar System

Dark cold and whipped by supersonic
winds ice giant Neptune is the eighth and
most distant planet in our solar system.
More than 30 times as far from the Sun as
Earth Neptune is the only planet in our
solar system not visible to the naked
eye and the first predicted by mathematics
before its discovery.

When Earth was a young planet a large
chunk of rock smashed into it displacing
a portion of Earth’s interior. The resulting
chunks clumped together and formed
our Moon. With a radius of 1080 miles
(1738 kilometers) the Moon is the fifth
largest moon in our solar system (after
Ganymede Titan Callisto and Io).

Earth is the only planet which has a
single moon (so far). Other planets have
either zero or multiple moons.

However the scientists have claimed
that Earth has two extra ‘moons’ — made
entirely of dust and nine times wider than
our planet. After more than half a century
of speculation and controversy Hungarian
astronomers and _ physicists finally
confirmed the existence of these moons.

For Question 13.---------------
Explanation:

Famous Astronomers

Galileo experimented with and refined
telescopes. He is perhaps best known
for discovering the four most massive
moons of Jupiter now known as the
Galilean moons.

Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens
proposed that a thin flat ring circled
Saturn. He also discovered the first
moon of Saturn Titan. He made the first
known drawing of the Orion Nebula.

In 1672 Cassini and colleague Jean
Richer used the parallax method to
determine the distance of Mars from
Earth permitting the first estimations of
the dimensions of the solar system. Using
a method outlined by Galileo Cassini
was also the first to make successful
measurements of longitude. Cassini made
the first observations of four of Saturn’s
moons: Iapetus Rhea Tethys and Dione.
In addition he discovered the Cassini
Division in the rings of Saturn in 167

Charles Messier (1730-1817) of France
developed an interest in astronomy
at an early age having witnessed a

Great Red Spot

The Great Red Spot is a persistent
anticyclonic storm on the planet
Jupiter 22 degrees south of the
equator.

With tumultuous winds peaking at about
400 mph the Great Red Spot has been
swirling wildly over Jupiter’s skies for the
past 150 years or maybe even much longer
than that.

The storm is large enough to be visible
through Earth-based telescopes.

It was probably first observed by Cassini
who described it around 166

It is large enough to contain two or three
planets of Earth-size.

1 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 17.---------------
Explanation:

Apparent movements of the Sun

In the course of the year the earth‘s
revolution around the sun with its axis
inclined at 65 degrees to the plane of the
ecliptic changes the apparent altitude of
the midday sun.

The sun is vertically overhead at the
equator on two days each year. These
are usually 21 March and 21 September
though the date changes because of year is
not exactly 365 days. These two days are
termed equinoxes meaning ‘equal nights’
because on these two days all parts of
the world have equal days and nights.

After the March equinox the sun appears
to move north and is vertically overhead at
the Tropic of Cancer (25 degrees North)
on about 21 June. This is known as the
June or summer solstice when the northern
hemisphere will have its longest day and
night.

By about 22 December the sun is overhead
at the Tropic of Capricorn (25 degrees
South). This is the winter solstice when the
southern hemisphere will have its longest
day and shortest night.

The tropics thus mark the limits of the
overhead sun for beyond these the
sun is never overhead at any time of
the year.

1 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 18.---------------
Explanation:

Dawn and Twilight

The brief period between sunrise and full
daylight is called dawn and that between
sunset and complete darkness is termed

2


This is caused by the fact that during
the periods of dawn and twilight the
earth receives diffused or refracted
light from the sun whilst it is still
below the horizon.

Since the sun rises and sets in a vertical
path at the equator the period during
which refracted light is received is
short.

But in temperate latitudes the sun
rises and sets in an oblique path and
the period of refracted light is longer.
It is much longer still at the poles so that
the winter darkness is really the only
twilight most of the time.

1 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 19.---------------
Explanation:
Oort Cloud

The Oort Cloud is an extended shell of icy
objects that exist in the outermost reaches
of the solar system. It is named after
astronomer Jan Oort who first theorised
its existence. The Oort Cloud is roughly
spherical and is thought to be the origin
of most of the long-period comets that have
been observed.

This cloud of particles is theorized to be
the remains of the disc of material that
formed the Sun and planets. Astronomers
now refer to those primeval objects as a
protoplanetary disk.

ad

BELT

 

The most likely theory is that the material
now in the Oort Cloud probably formed
closer to the young Sun in the earliest
epochs of solar system formation. As the

cerJSCORE

planets grew and in particular as Jupiter
coalesced and migrated to its present
position its gravitational influence is
thought to have scattered many icy objects
out to their present position in the Oort
cloud.

Objects in the Oort Cloud are also referred
to as Trans-Neptunian objects. This name
also applies to objects in the Kuiper Belt.

The Oort Cloud is very distant from the
Sun and it can be disrupted by the nearby
passage of a star nebula or by actions in
the disk of the Milky Way. Those actions
knock cometary nuclei out of their orbits
and send them on a headlong rush toward
the Sun.

1 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 20.---------------
Explanation:

Latitudes:

The Equator is an imaginary line around
the middle of the Earth. It is halfway
between the North and South Poles and
divides the Earth into the Northern and
Southern Hemispheres.

The Earth is widest at its Equator. The
distance around the Earth at the Equator
its circumference is 40075 kilometers
(24901 miles).

Orbital plane is the plane formed by the
orbit. The axis of the Earth is an imaginary
line that makes an angle of 66%° with its
orbital plane.

Latitudes and Longitudes are imaginary
lines used to determine the location of a
place on earth. Parallels of Latitudes are
the angular distance of a point on the
earth’s surface measured in degrees from
the center of the Earth.

As the earth is slightly flattened at the
poles the linear distance of a degree of
latitude at the pole is a little longer than
that at the equator.

Besides the equator (0°) the north pole
(90°N) and the south pole (90°S) there are
four important parallels of latitudes—

>» Tropic of Cancer (23%° N) in the
Northern Hemisphere.

» Tropic of Capricorn (23%° S) in the
Southern Hemisphere.

» Arctic Circle at 66%° North of the
Equator.

» Antarctic Circle at 66%° South of the
Equator.
1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 21.---------------
Explanation:

Direct Sources

The most easily available solid earth
material is surface rock or the rocks we get
from mining areas.

Volcanic eruption forms another source
of direct information. As and when the
molten material (magma) is thrown
onto the surface of the earth it becomes
available for laboratory analysis. However
it is difficult to ascertain the depth of the
source of such magma.

Direct sources include rock materials from
mining areas and molten magma from
volcanic eruptions.

Indirect Sources

Analysis of properties of matter provides
indirect information about the interior of
the Earth.

Another source of information is the
meteors that at times reach the earth.

Indirect sources include meteors that
at times reach the earth gravitation
magnetic field and seismic activity.

1 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 22.---------------
Explanation:

Surface waves: These waves travel
through the surface of the earth. Due to
their amplitude they are most destructive
waves causing extensive damage on the
surface of the earth.

Types of Surface Waves:

>» Love waves (L-waves) - its fastest
surface waves and move on ground
side to side. It is confined to surface
of the crust love wave is wounded by
Seismograph.

>» Rayleigh waves- Rayleigh waves
rolls along the ground just like a wave
roll across a lake or an ocean.

Body waves: These waves travel through
the interiors of the earth. While travelling
through interiors their characteristics
such as velocity and wavelength changes
according to the density of the medium in
which they are travelling. The body waves
are recorded at different seismograph
stations located at different places
throughout the surface of earth. Body
waves can be further categorized into

>» Primary Waves: Also known as
P-waves. These are longitudinal or


compressive in nature. These waves
can pass through solid as well as liquid
medium. The velocity of these waves
increases with increasing density and
rigidity of the medium. (They travel
faster in solid than in liquids)

» Secondary waves: Also known as
S-waves. These are transverse or
distortional in nature. These waves
cannot pass through liquid medium.
Their velocity also increases with
increasing rigidity of the medium.

Nature of Body Waves:

» These waves (both P and S waves)
travel faster in rigid medium.

» Among P and S waves the velocity of P
waves is more.

>» These waves while passing from
one medium to another medium
of different density experiences
refraction (bending from original
path) similar to the light waves.

2 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 23.---------------
Explanation:

Conrad discontinuity: The Conrad
discontinuity corresponds to the sub-
horizontal boundary in continental crust at
which the seismic wave velocity increases
in a discontinuous way. This boundary is
observed in various continental regions
at a depth of 15 to 20 km between outer
and inner crust however it is not found in
oceanic regions.

Mohorovicic discontinuity: The
Mohorovicic Discontinuity or “Moho” is
the boundary between the crust and the
mantle.

Repetti discontinuity: This discontinuity
is found between upper and lower Mantle.
This is marked by general decrease in
velocity of seismic waves between upper
and lower mantle.

Gutenberg discontinuity: The
Gutenberg discontinuity occurs within
Earth’s interior at a depth of about 1800
mi (2900 km) below the surface generally
between mantle and core where there
is an abrupt change in the seismic waves
(generated by earthquakes or explosions)
that travel through Earth.

Lehmann discontinuity: The Lehmann
discontinuity is an abrupt increase of
P-wave and S-wave velocities at the depth of
220430 km discovered by seismologist Inge
Lehmann. It appears beneath continents
but not usually beneath oceans and does


not readily appear in globally averaged
studies. It is generally found between
outer and inner core.

Supplementary notes:
Giraffe

e The giraffe has been placed in Appendix
II of CITES which places prohibitions


2

on uncontrolled trade in a_ species.
The Conference of Parties (CoP) to the
Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species or CITES in Geneva
passed a resolution to place the giraffe in
Appendix II of CITES.

Giraffes those tall stately and graceful
animals of Africa’s savannahs have been
accorded protection from unregulated trade
as the world finally woke up to their ‘silent
extinction’.

The Appendix II listing was proposed by
Central African Republic Chad Kenya
Mali Niger and Senegal.

“Appendix II includes species not
necessarily threatened with extinction but
in which trade must be controlled in order
to avoid utilization incompatible with their
survival”

Giraffes once ranged over much of the semi-
arid savannah and savannah woodlands of
Africa. But their numbers have plummeted
dramatically — by up to 40 per cent over
the last 30 years — due to threats including
international trade in their parts as well
as habitat loss civil unrest and illegal
hunting.

While giraffes fall prey to poaching for bush
meat bones skin and tail hair there is also
a significant amount of international trade
in their bone carvings and trophies.

There is currently only one recognized
species of giraffe with nine sub-species.
They have been listed as ‘vulnerable’ on
the International Union for Conservation
of Species Red List since 2016 with some
sub-species classified as ‘endangered” or
‘critically endangered’.

Five of the nine sub-species have only a
small wild population while four have
a decreasing population trend. All are
affected by trade.

While the Appendix II listing will not stop
all trade in giraffe parts it will ensure this
is not contributing to further population
declines and provide global scale data that
could not otherwise be obtained.

Option (a) is correct: Researchers develop
pesticide alternative to protect plants form


viral infection. The programme first triggers
plants’ cells to multiply the virus which

Supplementary notes:

Small interfering RNAs’ (siRNAs)

Anovel approach to vaccinate plants against
viruses can be used as an alternative to
toxic pesticides that is harmful both to
insects and the environment.

During a virus attack plants initiate a
two-stage molecular defense programme
which protects them “both at the site of the
infection and throughout its structure.

The programme first triggers plants’ cells
to multiply the virus which creates viral
ribonucleic acid molecules (RNAs). Using
special enzyme scissors the plants then
detect these molecules and cut them — a

process which produces ‘small interfering

The siRNAs spreads throughout the
plant and attach them to a protein called
Argonaute. The siRNAs then leads the
protein to RNAs viruses to kill them.

belongs to the family of brush-footed
butterflies or the Nymphalid.

This is the latest addition to Tamil Nadu’s
existing symbols from the natural world —
palmyra as the state tree gloriosa lily as
the state flower emerald dove as the state
bird and jackfruit as the state fruit and
Nilgiri tahr as the state animal.

This butterfly species is endemic to Western
Ghats.

Once the species is declared as a state
butterfly this will help channelizing
government funds towards a particular

environmental cause.

Tamil Nadu has a total of 32 species of
butterflies endemic to the state.

It has become the fifth India state after
Maharashtra (Blue Mormon) Uttarakhand
(Common peacock) Karnataka (Southern
birdwings) and Kerala (Malabar banded
peacock) to bestow a state emblem status
to one of its colorful insects.

Both southern bird wings which is the
largest butterfly species found in India
and Malabar banded peacocks are like the
Tamil Yeoman endemic to the Western
Ghats as well.

Explanation:

Sources of information about the interior
of the Earth

There aretwotypes of sources of information
about the interior of the Earth viz. Direct
and Indirect.

Direct sources

The sources which are obtained directly
from Earth’s interior are called Direct
sources.

These include materials obtained from
Mining or from scientific projects such
as “Deep Ocean Drilling Project” &
“Integrated Ocean Drilling Project” and the
Magma/Lava obtained from a volcanic
eruption etc.

The drilling projects provide better sources
of information than mining because they
can provide materials from the depth as
far as 12 km while in mining going beyond
3-4 km depth is not possible due to high
temperature and pressure at this depth.

Indirect sources

These are the sources that are not obtained
directly from the Earth’s interior but help
in the understanding of the same.

These include earthquake waves;
materials obtained from meteors;
earth’s gravitation magnetic & seismic
activities and the variability oftemperature
pressure and density of the Earth etc.

Although the materials obtained from
meteors are not from the Earth these
are similar to the Earth hence they
provide valuable information.

For Question 30.---------------
Explanation:

Geomagnetism

Earth’s magnetic field comes from this ocean
of iron which is an electrically conducting
fluid in constant motion. Sitting atop the
hot inner core the liquid outer core seethes
and roils like water in a pan on a hot stove.
The outer core also has “hurricanes”-
whirlpools powered by the Coriolis forces
of Earth’s rotation. These complex motions
generate our planet’s magnetism through a
process called the dynamo effect.

The Earth has two dominant magnetic
poles and several very weak
‘quadrupolar’ poles of which there
are at least mathematically about 8
in number. These poles are far weaker
than the dipole field and measure only
weak departures of the local geographic
field strength from the basic dipolar North-
South field.

Approximately geomagnetic dipole is
currently tilted at an angle of about
11 degrees to Earth’s rotational axis.
At the moment it’s located in northern
Canada.

Earth’s polarity is not a constant and it
keeps changing. Compass needles in Africa
for instance are drifting about 1 degree per
decade. And globally the magnetic field has
weakened 10% since the 19th century.

Sometimes the field completely
flips. The north and the south poles
swap places. Such reversals recorded
in the magnetism of ancient rocks are
unpredictable. They come at irregular
intervals averaging about 300000 years.

For Question 33.---------------
Explanation:

Earth’s layers

The earth is made up of several concentric
layers viz. lithosphere mesosphere and
barysphere.

The lithosphere contains crust and upper
mantle.

The mesosphere contains lower mantle.
In the mesosphere the upper part of
the mantle is in a molten state called
asthenosphere.

Barysphere contains both the outer
and inner cores.

Parts of the earth’s crust are immersed
by oceans and seas. These form the
hydrosphere.

Extending skywards for over fifteen miles
the earth is enveloped by a mass of gases
that make up the atmosphere.

In geology the word “discontinuity” is
used for a surface at which seismic waves
change velocity.

The discontinuity in density between the
upper crust and lower crust is known as
Conrad discontinuity.

The boundary between lower crust and
upper mantle where there is a sudden
increase in density and velocity of

seismic waves decreases is called Moho-
discontinuity.

The discontinuity in density between
upper mantle and lower mantle is known
as Repetti discontinuity.

For Question 35.---------------
Explanation:

Exogenetic geomorphic process

Denudation is a broad term that includes
both weathering and erosion.

Sediments are a result of denudation as
well as lithification.

Lithification is the process that turns
loose unconsolidated sediment into solid
sedimentary rock through compaction
cementation and recrystallization.

Essentially lithification is a process of
porosity destruction through compaction
and cementation.

Correct Option: (c)

For Question 36.---------------
Explanation:
Rocks

Rocks are an aggregate of one or more
minerals held together by chemical bonds.

Based on the mode of formation three
major groups of rocks are defined: igneous
sedimentary and metamorphic.

Igneous Rocks

These rocks are formed by cooling
solidification and crystallization of hot and
molten magma found below the earth’s
crust. These are also known as Parent
Primary or Basic Rocks.

Igneous rocks are much less affected by
chemical weathering but physical and
mechanical weathering affects them
resulting in their disintegration and
decomposition.

Nearly 90% of the crust is made up of
igneous rocks.

Sedimentary rocks

Sediments are a result of denudation
(weathering and erosion) of all types of
rocks.

Sedimentary rocks are formed by the
lithification of sediments.

Hence they are layered or stratified of
varying thickness. Example: sandstone
shale etc.

Metamorphic rocks

All rocks whether igneous or sedimentary
may become metamorphic or changed rocks
under great heat and pressure.

Their original character and appearance
may be greatly altered by such forces




particularly intense earth

movements.

Feldspar

Silicon and oxygen are common elements
in all types of feldspar and sodium
potassium calcium aluminum etc. are
found in specific feldspar variety.

Half of the earth’s crust is composed of
feldspar.

It has a light cream to salmon pink color.

e Feldspar is used in ceramics and
glassmaking.
Pyroxene
e It consists of calcium aluminum

magnesium iron and silica.

Pyroxene forms 10 percent of the earth’s
crust. It is commonly found in meteorites.

It is green or black in color.

Correct Option: (c)

For Question 38.---------------
Explanation:

Rock Cycle

Rocks do not remain in their original form
for long but may undergo a transformation.
The rock cycle is a continuous process
through which old rocks are transformed
into new ones.

Igneous rocks are primary rocks and other
rocks (sedimentary and metamorphic) form
from these primary rocks. Igneous rocks
can be changed into metamorphic rocks.

The fragments derived out of igneous and
metamorphic rocks form into sedimentary
rocks.

Sedimentary rocks themselves can turn
into fragments and the fragments can be
a source for the formation of sedimentary
rocks.

The crustal rocks Ggneous metamorphic
and sedimentary) once formed may be
carried down into the mantle (interior of
the earth) through subduction process
(parts or whole of crustal plates going
down under another plate in zones of plate
convergence) and the same meltdown due


to increase in temperature in the interior
and turn into molten magma the original
source for igneous rocks.

 Correct Option: (c)

Explanation

Metamorphic rocks

Metamorphic rocks form under the action
of pressure volume and temperature (PVT)
change.

Metamorphism occurs when rocks are forced
down to lower levels by tectonic processes
or when molten magma rising through the
crust comes in contact with the crustal
rocks or the underlying rocks are subjected
to great amounts of pressure by overlying
rocks. In Metamorphism consolidated
rocks undergo recrystallization and
reorganization of materials within original
rocks.

In the process of metamorphism in some
rocks grains or minerals get arranged in
layers or lines. Such an arrangement of
minerals or grains in metamorphic rocks is
called foliation or lineation.

Sometimes minerals or materials of
different groups are arranged into
alternating thin to thick layers appearing
in light and dark shades. Such a structure
in metamorphic rocks is called banding and
rocks displaying banding are called banded
rocks.

Metamorphic rocks have been put under
great pressure heated squashed or
stretched. So fossils do not usually survive
these extreme conditions. Generally it
is only sedimentary rocks that contain
fossils.

1 Correct Option: (a)

Explanation

Minerals:

A mineral is composed of two or more
elements. But sometimes single element
minerals like Sulphur Gold Copper
Silver Graphite etc are found.

A mineral is a naturally occurring organic
and inorganic substance having an orderly
atomic structure and definite chemical
composition and physical properties.

The elements in the earth’s crust are
rarely found exclusively but are usually
combined with other elements to make
various substances. These substances are
recognized as minerals.

For Question 40.---------------
Explanation:

Process of Erosion

Large scale transportation of the weathered
materials is termed erosion. It can be done
through Corrasion Attrition Corrosion
Hydraulic Action Plucking ete.

Corrasion or abrasion. This is the
mechanical grinding of the river’s traction
load against the banks and bed of the river’.
The rock fragments are hurled against the
sides of the river and also roll along the
bottom of the river.

Attrition. This is the wear and tear of the
transported materials themselves when
they roll and collide into one another.

Corrosion or solution. This is the chemical
or solvent action of water on soluble or
partly-soluble rocks with which the river
comes into contact. For example calcium
carbonate in limestones is easily dissolved
and removed in solution.

1 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 41.---------------
Explanation:

Cryosols

These are the frost-affected soils of a wide variety
of unconsolidated materials including glacial
till and aeolian alluvial colluvial and residual
materials.

Almost all Cryosols contain accumulations
of ice such as ice crystals ice lenses ice
layers (vein ice) ice wedges or massive
ground ice often to a thickness of several
meters.
Cryosols contain much organic carbon
and act as carbon sinks under the present
climate.

The nitrogen potassium and phosphorus
contents of Cryosols are generally low.
Most plant nutrients are locked into the
surface organic matter

Geographically Cryosols are circumpolar
in both the northern and_ southern
hemispheres. They cover about 13% of
the global surface area. Cryosols occur
in the permafrost regions of the Arctic
and are also widespread in the sub-arctic
zone discontinuous in the boreal zone and
sporadic in more temperate mountainous
regions.

Major areas with Cryosols are found in
Russia Canada China and Alaska and
parts of Mongolia. Smaller occurrences
have been reported from permafrost regions
in northern Europe Greenland and the ice-
free areas of Antarctica.

For Question 42.---------------
Explanation:

Laterite Soil

Laterite has been derived from the Latin
word ‘Later’ which means brick. The
laterite soils develop in areas with high
temperatures and high rainfall. These
are the result of intense leaching due to
tropical rain.

With rain lime and silica are leached
away and soils rich in iron oxide and
aluminum compounds are left behind.
The humus content of the soil is removed
fast by bacteria that thrive well in high
temperatures. These soils are poor in
organic matter nitrogen phosphate and
calcium while iron oxide and potash are in
excess.

Hence laterites are not suitable for
cultivation; however the application of
manures and fertilizers are required for
making the soil fertile for cultivation.

Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu Andhra
Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable for
tree crops like cashew nuts.

Laterite soils are widely cut as bricks for
use in house construction. These soils have
mainly developed in the higher areas of
the peninsular plateau. The laterite soils
are commonly found in Karnataka Kerala
Tamil Nadu Madhya Pradesh and the hilly
areas of Odisha and Assam.

Red and Yellow soil

Red soil develops on crystalline igneous
rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern
and southern part of the Deccan Plateau.

Along the piedmont zone of the Western
Ghat the long stretch of area is occupied
by red loamy soil.

Yellow and red soils are also found in parts
of Odisha and Chhattisgarh and in the
southern parts of the middle Ganga plain.

The soil develops a reddish color due to a
wide diffusion of iron in crystalline and
metamorphic rocks.

It looks yellow when it occurs in a hydrated
form. The fine-grained red and yellow
soils are normally fertile whereas coarse-
grained soils found in dry upland areas are
poor infertility. They are generally poor in
nitrogen phosphorous and humus.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 44.---------------
Explanation:

Alluvial Soils

Alluvial soils are widespread in the
northern plains and the river valleys.

These soils cover about 40 per cent of the
total area of the country.

They are depositional soils transported
and deposited by rivers and streams.

Through a narrow corridor in Rajasthan
they extend into the plains of Gujarat.

In the Peninsular region they are found
in deltas of the east coast and in the river
valleys. The alluvial soils vary in nature
from sandy loam to clay.

They are generally rich in potash but poor
in phosphorous.

In the Upper and Middle Ganga plain
two different types of alluvial soils have
developed viz. Khadar and Bhangar.

Khadar is the new alluvium and is deposited
by floods annually which enriches the soil
by depositing tine silts.

Bhangar represents a system of older
alluvium deposited away from the flood
plains.

Both the Khadar and Bhangar soils contain
calcareous concretions (Kankars).


These soils are more loamy and clayey in
the lower and middle Ganga plain and the
Brahamaputra valley.

The sand content decreases from the west
to east.

The colour of the alluvial soils varies from
the light grey to ash grey.

Its shades depend on the depth of the
deposition the texture of the materials
and the time taken for attaining maturity.
Alluvial soils arc intensively cultivated.

Soils in India

Black soil covers most of the Deccan Plateau
which includes parts of Maharashtra
Madhya Pradesh Gujarat Andhra Pradesh
and some parts of Tamil Nadu.

The black soils are generally clayey deep
and impermeable. They swell and become
sticky when wet and shrink when dried. So
during the dry season these soil develop
wide cracks. Thus there occurs a kind of
‘self ploughing’.

The sand content in Alluvial soil decreases
from the west to east.

Red soil develops on crystalline igneous
rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern
and southern part of the Deccan Plateau.

They are generally poor

Saline and Alkaline Soils

These soils are found in the drier parts of
Bihar Uttar Pradesh Haryana Punjab
Rajasthan etc. These soils are liable to
saline and alkaline efflorescence’s and are
known by different names such as reh
kallar usara etc.

Some of the salts are brought by the river
which percolates in the sub-soils of the
plains. In canal irrigated areas and in areas
of high sub soil water table the injurious
salts are transferred from below to the top
soil by capillary action. The accumulation
of these salts makes the soil infertile and
renders it unfit for agriculture.

The Canal irrigated areas are most affected
because of this.

» These rocks constitute the Sial portion
of the crust.
>» Due to the excess of silicon acidic
magma cools fast and it does not flow
and spread far away.

» High mountains are formed of this
type of rock.

» These rocks have a lesser content
of heavier minerals like iron and
magnesium and normally contain
quartz and feldspar.

» Add rocks are hard compact massive
and resistant to weathering.

Basic Rocks:

» These rocks are poor in silica (about
AO per cent); magnesia content is up to
AO per cent and the remaining 40 per
cent is spread over iron oxide lime
aluminum alkalis potassium etc.

> Due to low silica content the parent
material of such rocks cools slowly and
thus flows and spreads far away.

» This flow and cooling gives rise to
plateaus. Presence of heavy elements
imparts to these rocks a dark color.

and exogenic forces.

Earth’s crust and its surface are constantly
evolving (changing) due to various forces
emanating from below (endogenic forces)
as well as above the surface of the earth
(exogenic forces).

Endogenic processes include folding
faulting warping volcanism thus they
cause upliftment. Exogenic processes
include weathering and erosion hence
degradation. But both of them are
needed to shape the landforms on the

Earth.

Lacoliths are large dome-shaped intrusive
bodies with a level base and connected by a
pipe-like conduit from below.

When the lava makes its way through
cracks and the fissures developed in the
land it solidifies almost perpendicular
to the ground. It gets cooled in the
same position to develop a wall-like
structure. Such structures are called
dykes. These are the most commonly
found intrusive forms in the western
Maharashtra area.

Sills unlike dykes are thin horizontal
intrusive igneous landform.

Lapoliths are intrusive’ volcanic
landforms having saucer shape and
concave to the sky.

For Question 60.---------------
Explanation:

Earthquake

An earthquake in simple words is shaking
of the Earth.

It is a natural event caused due to release
of energy which generates waves that
travel in all directions.

All the natural earthquakes
originated in the lithosphere.

are

The release of energy occurs along a fault
a sharp break in the crustal rocks.

The point where the energy is released
is called the focus or hypocentre of an
earthquake. The energy waves traveling in
different directions reach the surface. The
point on the surface nearest to the focus
is called epicenter. It is the first one to
experience the waves.

This release of energy is propagated
as waves or simply saying Earthquake
Waves.

Several types of interaction between waves
and the subsurface geology (i.e. the rocks)
are commonly observable on seismograms
such as:

>» Refraction
> Reflection
>» Dispersion
>» Diffraction
» Attenuation
Refraction

» The change in direction depends on
the ratio of the wave velocities of the
two different rocks.


Rock
Type 2

Velocity in rock type 2 is greater
than velocity in rock type 



Rock
Type 2

Velocity in rock type 2 is less
than velocity in rock type 

 

Reflection

>» A seismic reflection occurs when a
wave impinges on a change in rock
type. Part of the energy carried by the
incident wave is transmitted through
the material (that’s the refracted wave
described above) and part is reflected
back into the medium that contained
the incident wave.

Correct Option: ()

Earthquake Waves

The Earthquakes Waves are recorded on
the seismograph.

There are basically two types of Earthquake
Waves — body waves and_ surface
waves.

Body Waves

Body waves are generated at the focus and
move in all the directions through the body
of the Earth (8-dimensional). They are the
fastest in reaching to the surface.

They are of two types viz. Primary waves/
P-waves and Secondary waves/S-
waves.

Primary waves/P-waves

P-waves move longitudinally i.e. the
propagation and vibration are in the same
direction similar to the sound waves. They
are the fastest of all the earthquake waves.
They travel through gaseous liquid and
solid materials.

Secondary waves/S-waves

S-waves are second to reach the surface
after P-waves. As they can travel only
through solid materials of the Earth
they cannot pass through Earth’s
outer core therefore their shadow
zone is broader than that of P-waves.
This reveals that the outer core of the
Earth is not in solid form.

S-waves propagate transversally
i.e. the direction of propagation and the
direction of vibration is perpendicular to
each other.

Surface waves

Surface waves are generated when the
body waves interact with the surface rocks.
As they move along the surface and the
direction of the vibration is perpendicular
to the propagation these waves are
considered as the most damaging one.

There are two types of Surface waves
viz. Love Waves and Rayleigh Waves.

Love waves are transverse waves that
vibrate the ground in the horizontal
direction perpendicular to the direction
that the waves are traveling. They are
formed by the interaction of S waves with
Earth’s surface and shallow structure and
are dispersive waves.

Rayleigh waves are similar to water waves
in the ocean. They are the slowest of all
the seismic wave types. As a Rayleigh
wave passes a particle moves inan elliptical
trajectory that is counterclockwise.

Correct Option: (d)

For Question 61.---------------
Explanation:

Measurement of Earthquakes

Although the curve of Earthquake Waves
is recorded at Seismograph the intensity
and magnitude of the Earthquakes are
measured by two different scales namely
Richter Scale and Mercalli Scale.

Richter Scale

This scale developed by Charles Richter
measures the magnitude as related
to the energy released during the
Earthquake.

This scale is open-ended i.e. there is
not any end of the scale but it has
never measured any Earthquake of
magnitude greater than 

The Richter-scale in nature is
logarithmic based on 1 That is the
Earthquake at magnitude 5 is 10 times
more powerful than the Earthquake at
magnitude 4 and 100 times more than the
earthquake at magnitude 

Mercalli Scale

The Mercalli Intensity Scale developed
by Giuseppe Mercalli and expanded to


include 12 degrees of intensity Adolfo
Cancani. It was further modified again by
Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann and
today known as Modified Mercalli Intensity
Scale.

It measures the intensity of an
earthquake based on its actual impacts
on people the environment and the
Earth’s surface.

It is a linear close-ended linear Scale
scaled from 1-12 or I-XII with zero
effect in Intensity 1 Earthquake
and total destruction in Intensity 12
Earthquake.

 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 62.---------------
Explanation:

Extrusive Landforms

Extrusive landforms are formed from
material thrown out to the surface during
volcanic activity.

The materials thrown out include lava
flows pyroclastic debris volcanic bombs
ash dust and gases such as nitrogen
compounds sulfur compounds and minor
amounts of chlorine hydrogen and argon.

Some of the extrusive landforms are as
follows:

Fissure vent: A narrow linear volcanic
vent through which lava erupts usually
without any explosive activity.

Conical vent: A narrow cylindrical vent
through which magma flows out violently.

Mid-Ocean Ridges: The system of mid-
ocean ridges stretches across all the ocean
basins. Here the lava is basaltic and causes
the spreading of the seafloor. The central
portion of the mid-ocean ridges experiences
frequent eruptions.

The Shield Volcanoes: They are formed
if the lava has low viscosity. Hence they
are not steep. After the Basalt province
the shield volcanoes are the largest of all
the volcanoes. Examples are Mauna Loa
Hawaiian Islands USA and Galapagos
Islands.

Composite Volcanoes: They are formed in
many years after multiple eruptions. These
voleanoes contain pyroclastic materials
and ashes other than the thick and highly
viscous magmatic lava. Examples are
Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount St. Helens.

Caldera: When a large amount of magma
erupts in a short time the rock underlying
the magma collapses. This result in
depressions called Caldera. These are the
most explosive in nature.

36




e Flood basaltic province: A Highly fluid
lava made of basalt when erupt on the
surface it forms a flood basaltic province.
The Deccan Trap is one such example.

e Crater: Acrater is an inverted cone-shaped
vent through which the magma flows out.
When the volcano is not active the crater
appears as a bowl-shaped depression.
When water from rain or melted snow gets
accumulated in the crater it becomes a
crater lake. Lake Toba (Indonesia) is the
largest crater lake in the world.

e Cinder cone: Acinder coneisa steep circular
or oval-shaped hill of loose pyroclastic
fragments that have been built around a
volcanic vent.

Correct Option: (a)
For Question 63.---------------
Explanation:

Distribution of volcanoes

Continent-Continent convergent
boundaries: Where two plates containing
continental crust at their margins collide
there is little or no volcanism (such as
at the Himalaya).

Ocean-ocean or ocean-continent
convergent boundaries:

e These plate margins are the sites of most
violent and active volcanoes.

e Example- Ring of Fire which is at the
rim of Pacific ocean as under a number
of plates such as North American
plate Eurasian plate South American
plate etc.

Transform boundaries:

e Occasionally plate boundaries where
plates are mostly sliding by each other can
experience small amounts of volcanism as
well if there is a component of extension
across this boundary.

Intra-plate volcanoes:

e Intra-plate volcanoes are thought to be
associated with hot spots in the mantle
which remain stationary as plates move
over them.

e Example- Mauna Loa and Kilauea in
Hawaii.
Oceanic/oceanic: the Caribbean islands

e The South American Plate is moving
westwards due to seafloor spreading at the
Mid Atlantic Ridge.


e When it meets the Caribbean Plate it
descends (subducts) beneath it.

e The subduction causes low-density ocean
floor sediment to be scraped off the surface
of the South American Plate and thrust
onto the Caribbean Islands as accretionary
wedges in a process called obduction.

e The line of subduction is marked by the
deep sea Puerto Rico Trench.

e The Caribbean volcanic islands form a
curved linear chain or ‘volcanic island
are’ parallel and to the west of the
Puerto Rico Trench.

Correct Option: (a)
For Question 64.---------------
Explanation:

Continental Drift Theory

e Close examination ofa globe often results in
the observation that most of the continents
seem to fit together like a puzzle i.e. the
West African coastline seems to snuggle
nicely into the east coast of South America
and the Caribbean Sea and a similar
fit appears across the Pacific. The fit is
even more striking when the submerged
continental shelves are compared rather
than the coastlines.

e In 1912 Alfred Wegener (1880-1930)
noticed the same thing and proposed that
the continents were once compressed
into a single proto continent which he
called Pangaea surrounded by a single
mega ocean Panthalassa and over time
they have drifted apart into their current
distribution.

e He argued that around 200 million years
ago Pangaea began to split. Pangaea first
broke into two large continental masses
as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming
the northern and southern components
respectively. Subsequently Laurasia
and Gondwanaland continued to break
into various smaller continents that exist
today.

e Avariety of evidence was offered in support
of the continental drift. These were The
Matching of Continents (Gig-Saw-Fit);
Rocks of Same Age Across the Oceans;
Tillite glacial rocks; Placer Deposits and
Distribution of Fossils ete.

The Matching of Continents (Jig-Saw-Fit)

e Theshorelines of Africa and South America
facing each other have a remarkable and
unmistakable match even by using a
computer program.
Rocks of Same Age across the Oceans

The radiometric dating facilitated
correlating the rock formation from
different continents across the vast ocean.
The belt of ancient rocks of 2000 million
years from Brazil coast matches with those
from western Africa. The earliest marine
deposits along the coastline of South
America and Africa are of the Jurassic age.

Tillite glacial rocks

It is the sedimentary rock formed out
of deposits of glaciers in the form of
consolidated masses of unweathered
blocks.

The Gondwana system of sediments from
India is known to have its counterparts in
landmasses of the Southern Hemisphere
viz. Africa Falkland Island Madagascar
Antarctica and Australia.

Placer Deposits

The occurrence of rich placer deposits of
gold in the Ghana coast with the absence of
source rock in the region.

The gold-bearing veins are in Brazil and it
is obvious that the gold deposits of Ghana
are derived from the Brazil plateau.

Distribution of Fossils

Fossils of some exotic animals such as
Lemurs Mesosaurus etc must have been
at the contiguous lands. Etc.

1 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 65.---------------
Explanation:

Reasons for rejection

The pieces of evidence he presented were
all observational which supported his
hypothesis but didn’t prove it to certainty.

Coastlines are a temporary feature
and are liable to change. Several other
combinations of fitting in of unrelated
landforms could be attempted.

Both the tidal and pole fleeing forces
he suggested are believed to be
inadequate.

Plate Tectonics and seafloor spread
theory revealed later that crusts are
formed and consumed regularly while
as per Drift theory continents and ocean
must non-consumable.

As per Drift Theory Ocean and Continents
must be of the same age but later it was
found out that Oceans are much younger
than the Continents. Etc.


1 Correct Option: (c)
For Question 66.---------------
Explanation:

Seafloor spreading

Post Continental drift theory many studies
were done which revealed the following
facts.

> It was realized that all along the mid-
oceanic ridges volcanic eruptions are
common and they bring huge amounts
of lava to the surface in this area

» The rocks equidistant on either side
of the crest of mid-oceanic ridges
show remarkable similarities in
terms of the period of formation
chemical compositions and magnetic
properties.

>» The age of the rocks increases as
one moves away from the crest of
the Ridges.

>» The ocean crust rocks are much
younger than the continental rocks.
The age of rocks in the oceanic crust is
nowhere more than 200 million years
old while some of the continental rock
formations are as old as 3200 million
years.

» The sediments on the ocean floor are
unexpectedly very thin.

>» The deep trenches have deep-
seated earthquake occurrences
while in the mid-oceanic ridge
areas the quake foci have shallow
depths.

These facts led Harry Hess to propose
his hypothesis known as the “seafloor
spreading”. The force of the Seafloor
spreading was found to be Convective
current as postulated by Arthur Holmes.

Magma continuously wells upwards at the
mid-oceanic ridges producing currents of
magma flowing in opposite directions and
thus generating the forces that pull the
seafloor apart at the mid-oceanic ridges.

As the ocean floor is spread apart cracks
appear in the middle of the ridges allowing
molten magma to surface through the
cracks to form the newest ocean floor. Here
new crust is generated.

As the ocean floor moves away from the mid-
oceanic ridge eventually comes into contact
with a continental plate at a convergent
boundary subducted underneath the
continent and the crustal mass is consumed


Finally the lithosphere drives back into
the asthenosphere where it returns to a
heated state.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 68.---------------
Explanation:

Postulates of the Plate Tectonic Theory

The Earth’s surface is covered by a series of
some 25 major and minor crustal plates.

Both continental and oceanic plates
move form and destroyed.

The ocean floors are continually moving
spreading from the center sinking at the
edges and being regenerated. Convection
currents beneath the plates move the
crustal plates in different directions.

These lithospheric plates have been
constantly moving over the globe
throughout the history of the earth.

It is not the Continent that moves as
believed by Wegener rather continents
are part of a plate and what moves is
the plate.

All the plates without exception have
moved in the geological past and shall
continue to move in the future period as
well.

Thus there is no such thing as
supercontinent Pangaea or superocean
Panthalassa and continental masses
resting on the plates have been wandering
all through the geological period and
Pangaea was a result of converging of
different continental masses that were
parts of one or the other plates.


There have been many forms structure
shape and location of Pangaea and what
Wegner suggested is just one example of
it.

Crusts are formed as well as consumed
over a period (though geological).

Wegner’s idea about Tethys Sea was right
only with some modification that the
sea was not shifted but consumed in the
process of plate tectonic by Indo-Australian
plate and the Tethys’ convergent boundary
interaction.

More modifications will occur such as-
breaking of African plate as there is
seafloor spreading happening around East
Africa rift valley system consumption of
the Mediterranean Sea etc.

For Question 69.---------------
Explanation:

Rate of plate movement

The strips of the normal and reverse
magnetic field that parallel the mid-oceanic
ridges help scientists determine the rates
of plate movement.

These rates vary considerably.

The majority of the research shows that the
plates move at the average rate of between
approximately 60 cm/yr to 10 cm/yr.

The Eurasian Plate is moving away from
the North American Plate at a rate of about
38cm per year.

The Arctic Ridge has the slowest rate (less
than 5 cm/yr.) East Pacific Rise near
Easter Island in the South Pacific about
3400 km west of Chile has the fastest rate
(more than 15 cm/yr.).

Indian Plate moves northwards at 2
cm/yr.

Types of Fold mountains

On the basis of the period of origin fold
mountains are divided into very old
fold mountains old fold mountains and
Alpine(young) fold mountains.

Very Old Fold Mountains are more than
500 million years old. They have rounded
features (due to denudation) and are of low
elevation. Example: Laurentian mountains
Algoman mountains etc.
Old Fold Mountains had their origin
before the Tertiary period(66 mya). The
Appalachians in North America Aravalli

For Question 72.---------------
Explanation:

Types of Folds

According to the shape the folds are of
many types:

Symmetrical Folds: These are ordinary
folds. The limbs of the folds are equally
inclined on either side.


Asymmetrical Fold: One of the limbs is
more inclined than the other.

Monoclinal Fold: In this fold one limb
makes a right angle with the surface but
the other limb is ordinarily inclined.

Isoclinal Fold: The two limbs are so much
inclined in such a way that they appear
equally inclined and parallel to each other.

Recumbent Fold: In this fold the two
limbs are so much inclined that they
become horizontal.

Overturned Fold: In this fold one limb
is overturned over the other limb. The
difference between the overturned and
recumbent folds is that the overturned
limbs are not horizontal like those of
recumbent fold.

Plunging Fold: If the axis of the fold is
not parallel to the horizontal but makes
an angle with it it is known as Plunging
Fold.

Fan Fold: It is a great anticline which
has many small anticlines and synclines.
It is also known as Anticlinorium. A great
syncline having many small anticlines and
synclines is called Synclinorium.

Open Fold: If the angle between the limbs
of a fold is obtuse the fold is called Open
Fold.

Closed Fold: If the angle between the
limbs of a fold is acute it is called Closed
Fold.

For Question 73.---------------
Explanation:

Volcanism

A volcano is an opening in the earth’s
crust through which gases molten rocks
materials (lava) ash steam etc. are emitted
outward in the course of an eruption.

Such vents or openings occur in those parts
of the earth’s crust where the rock strata
are relatively weak.

Volcanic activity is an example of endogenic
process. Depending upon the explosive
nature of the volcano different land forms
can be formed such as a plateau (if the
volcano is not explosive) or a mountain (if
the volcano is explosive in nature).

Types of Lava:

Basic lavas: There are highly fluid. They
are dark coloured like basalt rich in iron
and magnesium but poor in silica. They
are affect extensive areas spreading out as
thin sheets. The resultant volcano is gently


sloping with a wide diameter and form a
flattened shield or dome.

Acidic lavas: There lavas are highly viscous
with a melting point. They are light-
coloured of low density and have a high
percentage of silica. They flow slowly and
seldom travel far. The resultant cone is
therefore steep sided.

For Question 74.---------------
Explanation:
The Circum Pacific Belt:

Due to subduction of the Pacific plate
below the Asiatic plate the large number
of volcanic eruptions are found circling
Pacific Ocean known as Ring of Fire
which extends through the Andes of South
America Central America Mexico the
Cascade Mountains of Western United
States the Aleutian Islands Kamchatka
the Kuril Isles Japan the Philippines
Celebes New Guinea the Solomon Islands
New Caledonia and New Zealand where
about 80 active volcanoes are found.

The Circum-Pacific belt meets the mid-
continental belt in the East Indies. This
belt is characterised by high volcanic cones
and volcanic mountains.

The volcanoes of the Aleutian Island
Hawaii Island and Japan are found in
Chains.

Cotapaxi is the highest volcanic mountain
(6035m) in the world.

Other important volcanoes found in this
belt are Fuziyama Shasta Rainer and
Hood.

Volcanic eruptions occur in this belt because
of the subduction of the Pacific plate below
the Asiatic plate.

The Mid-Continental Belt:

Having various volcanoes of the Alpine
Mountain Chain Mediterranean Sea
(Stromboli Vesuvius Etna etc.) volcanoes
of the Aegean Sea Mt. Ararat Elburz and
Hindukush. There are several volcanic
free zones found along the Alps and
the Himalayas come under this belt.
Kilimanjaro Elgon Birunga and Rungwe
etc. are the volcanoes found in the Rift
Valleys of Africa.

In the region where the boundaries of
Persia Afghanistan and Baluchistan
meet there are several volcanic cones of
large size and one or two of them emit
steam and other gases. This region has also
a few extinct volcanoes.


The Mid Atlantic Belt:

It includes the volcanoes of the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge which are associated with
the Atlantic Ocean and are located either
on swells or ridges rising from the sea floor
or on or near the edge of the continent
where it slopes abruptly into the deep
oceanic basins.

The volcanoes formed along the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge actually represent the
splitting zone of the American plate
moving towards west and the Eurasian
plate moving towards east representing
the zones of crystal movement.

In the splitting zone there is constant
upwelling of Magma hence known as
crustal weakness.

Volcanoes in this belt are generally of
fissure-eruption type such as Volcanoes
of Lesser Antilles Azores and St. Helens
etc.

For Question 82.---------------
Explanation:

Landforms by running water

e River capture: It is a geomorphological
phenomenon occurring when a stream
or river drainage system or watershed is
diverted from its own bed and flows instead
down the bed of a neighboring and more
powerful stream. It can be due to many
reasons such as Tectonic earth movements
Headward erosion etc. The now-dry valley
of the original stream is known as a wind
gap. The beheaded stream is called misfit.


Example- Yamuna captured the Saraswati
river(used to flow into the Arabian Sea).

e Ox-bow lakes: In the lower course of a
river a meander becomes very much more
pronounced. The outside bend or concave
bank is so rapidly eroded that the river
becomes almost a complete circle. There
comes a time when the river cuts through
the narrow neck of the loop abandoning an
ox-bow lake. The river then flows straight.

e River Rejuvenation: When there is a
sudden fall in the sea level or upliftment
of the land the slow and old rivers the
disturbance enables a rise in the river’s
potential energy increasing its erosion
rate of the erstwhile slow and old river
called river rejuvenation.

e Ifrejuvenation occurs in the upper course
the river valleys are deepened and steep-
sided gorges are formed. In the middle and
lower course vertical corrasion replaces
lateral corrasion and the existing meanders
are vertically eroded by the rejuvenated
stream.

Explanation:

Types of Deltas

e A delta is a depositional landform that
occurs at the mouth of a river.

e There are two major ways of classifying
deltas. One considers the influence that
creates the landform while the other
considers its shape.

On the basis of Influence

e Thereare four main types of deltas classified
by the processes that control the build-up
of silt: wave-dominated tide-dominated
Gilbert deltas and estuarine deltas.

e Ina wave-dominated delta the movement
of waves controls a delta’s size and shape.
Example- Nile delta
e The tide-dominated deltas usually form
in areas with a large tidal range or area
between high tide and low tide. Example-
Ganga-Brahmaputra delta.

e Gilbert deltas are formed as rivers deposit
large coarse sediments.

e Estuarine deltas form as a river does not
empty directly into the ocean but instead
forms an estuary. Example- Yellow
river(china) St. Lawrence(USA)

On the basis of Shape

e They are various types such as Arcuate
Cuspate Bird’s foot etc.

e Deltas with this triangular or fan shape are
called arcuate deltas. Example-Ganga
delta Nile delta etc.

e Stronger waves form a cuspate delta
which is more pointed than the arcuate
delta and is tooth-shaped. Example- Tiber
River(Rome).

e A bird-foot delta has few widely spaced
distributaries making it look like a bird’s

foot. Example- Mississippi River.

Correct Option: (d)
For Question 84.---------------
Explanation:

Alluvial cones and fans

e Alluvial cones: When rivers leave the
mountains and enter the plains their
channel gradient drops substantially
resulting in a drop in the load-carrying
capacity of the river. Consequently load
consisting of finer to coarser and big ‘sized
materials coming from the upstream are
deposited at the point of break in slope
of foothill zone and thus alluvial cones
are fonned. When several alluvial fans
get combined it forms the Bhabhar
region.

e Alluvial Fans: When the river descends from
the bills it spreads the load in a vast area.
This results in the formation of fan shaped
plains called alluvial fans. When several
alluvial fans get combined it forms
foothill plains or Terai region.

Aeolian landforms

e The heaps or mounds of sand deposited
by wind are called sand dunes. They keep
changing their position in the direction of
wind. Sand dunes of crescent shape having
two horns are called Barchans.

e The deposition of very thin soil particles
brought by the wind in the outskirts of the
desert region is called Loess plain.

e Playa or dry lake is a flat-bottom
depression found in interior desert basins
and adjacent to coasts within arid and
semiarid regions.

e It is periodically covered by water that
slowly filtrates into the groundwater
system or evaporates into the atmosphere
causing the deposition of salt sand and
mud along the bottom and around the
edges of the depression.

Coral reefs and their probable evolution

e A fringing reef is a coralline platform lying
close to the shore extending outwards from
the mainland sometimes separated from
the shore by a shallow lagoon.

e A barrier reef is separated from the coast
by a much wider and deeper channel or
lagoon. The reef is partially submerged.

 

e Atolls are similar to barrier reefs except
that they are circular in shape enclosing


a shallow lagoon without any land in the
center. The encircling ring is usually

broken in a few places to allow the free flow
of water.

 

e The most widely accepted theory is that
put forward by Charles Darwin.

e He assumed that all coral reefs began
as fringing reefs around an island or
the topmost portions of extinct volcanoes
that stood above the ocean bed. Due to a
general down warping of the earth’s crust
the islands gradually subsided.

e The corals continued to grow upwards to
keep pace with the subsidence. The growth
was more vigorous at the outward edge
than the landward edge because of the more
favorable living conditions for corals so the
encircling reef widened. It then formed a
barrier reef with a lagoon between the
island and the reef.

e Eventually when the land completely
submerged only the outer rims of the reefs
were seen forming an atoll. The submerged
island was covered by a layer of sediment
so that the characteristic circular lagoon
is generally shallow. Thus atolls mark the
position of the former islands

e RA. Daly’s glacial control theory put
forward in 1910 is another important
contribution in this regard. He believed
that during the height of the Ice Ages the
water was too cold for any coral growth
to take place. With the absence of a coral
barrier marine erosion was able to attack
and lower the islands. With the return of the
warmer climate the water that was locked
up in the ice sheets melted. Consequently
there was a rise in the sea level which in
some cases submerged these lower islands.
On these platforms corals began to grow
upwards at the rate of a foot in a decade to
keep pace with the rising water level. Coral
reefs where islands still project above sea
level and atolls were thus formed.

e The combination of these two theories
accounts for all the important features of
coral reefs and atolls.

1 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 91.---------------
Explanation:

Depositional Landforms by Groundwater

Many depositional forms develop within
the limestone caves.

The chief chemical in limestone is calcium
carbonate (calcite) which is easily soluble in
carbonated water (carbon dioxide absorbed
rainwater). This calcium carbonate is
deposited when the water carrying it in
the solution evaporates or loses its carbon
dioxide as it trickles over rough rock
surfaces.

Stalactites hang as icicles of different
diameters. Normally they are broad at
their bases and taper towards the free ends
showing up in a variety of forms.

Stalagmites rise up from the floor of the
caves. In fact stalagmites form due to
dripping water from the surface or
through the thin pipe of the stalactite
immediately below it.


Stalagmites may take the shape of a
column a disc with either a smooth
rounded bulging end or a miniature crater-
like depression.

The stalagmite and __ stalactites
eventually fuse to give rise to columns
and pillars of different diameters.

1 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 92.---------------
Explanation:

Depositional Landforms

Alluvial fans

Alluvial fans are formed when streams
flowing from higher levels break into
foot slope plains of low gradient.

Normally very coarse load is carried by
streams flowing over mountain slopes.

This load becomes too heavy for the streams
to be carried over gentler gradients and gets
dumped and spread as a broad low to high
cone shaped deposit called alluvial fan.

Usually the streams which flow over fans
are not confined to their original channels
for long and shift their position across
the fan forming many channels called
distributaries.

Alluvial fans in humid areas show normally
low cones with gentle slope from head to toe
and they appear as high cones with steep
slope in arid and semi-arid climates.

Deltas

Deltas are like alluvial fans but develop at
a different location.

The load carried by the rivers is dumped
and spread into the sea. If this load is not
carried away far into the sea or distributed
along the coast it spreads and accumulates
as a low cone.

Unlike in alluvial fans the deposits making
up deltas are very well sorted with clear
stratification.

The coarsest materials settle out first and
the finer fractions like silts and clays are
carried out into the sea.

As the delta grows the _ river
distributaries continue to increase in
length and delta continues to build up
into the sea.

Floodplains

Deposition develops a floodplain just as
erosion makes valleys.

YA


Floodplain is a major landform of river
deposition. Large sized materials are
deposited first when stream channel breaks
into a gentle slope.

Thus normally fine sized materials like
sand silt and clay are carried by relatively
slow moving waters in gentler channels
usually found in the plains and deposited
over the bed and when the waters spill over
the banks during flooding above the bed.

A river bed made of river deposits is the
active floodplain. The floodplain above the
bank is inactive floodplain.

Inactive floodplain above the banks
basically contain two types of deposits —
flood deposits and channel deposits.

In plains channels shift laterally and
change their courses occasionally leaving
cut-off courses which get filled up
gradually.

Such areas over flood plains built up by
abandoned or cut-off channels contain
coarse deposits.

The flood deposits of spilled waters carry
relatively finer materials like silt and clay.

The flood plains in a delta are called delta
plains.

Meanders

In large flood and delta plains rivers rarely
flow in straight courses.

Loop-like channel patterns called meanders
develop over flood and delta plains.

Meander is not a landform but is only
a type of channel pattern.

This is because of (i) propensity of water
flowing over very gentle gradients to work
laterally on the banks; (i) unconsolidated
nature of alluvial deposits making up the
banks with many irregularities which
can be used by water exerting pressure
laterally; (iii) coriolis force acting on the
fluid water deflecting it like it deflects the
wind.

When the gradient of the channel becomes
extremely low water flows leisurely and
starts working laterally.

Slight irregularities along the banks slowly
get transformed into a small curvature in
the banks; the curvature deepens due to
deposition on the inside of the curve and
erosion along the bank on the outside.

If there is no deposition and no erosion or
undercutting the tendency to meander is
reduced. Normally in meanders of large
rivers there is active deposition along the


concave bank and undercutting along the
convex bank.

The concave bank is known as cut-off bank
which shows up as a steep scarp and the
convex bank presents a long gentle profile.
As meanders grow into deep loops the
same may get cut-off due to erosion at the
inflection points and are left as ox-bow
lakes.

For Question 93.---------------
Explanation:

Erosional Landforms

Yardangs:

Yardangs are narrow streamlined ridges
that are usually three to four times longer
than they are wide. They are made up
of long ridges of hard resistant rocks
alternating with narrow furrows of soft
rocks. Here both the bands of hard and soft
rocks aligned vertically to the direction of
the blowing prevailing winds. The process
of abrasion is accelerated in the course of
the blowing prevailing winds assisting
in wearing the soft bands of rocks into
narrow corridors between the hard layers.
Eventually the bands of hard rocks remain
standing high above the soft bands that
have been worn into narrow corridors.

Zeugen:

A zeugen is a tabular mass of resistant
rock standing prominently in the desert.
It is usually composed of alternating layers
of hard and soft rocks. These alternating
bands of rock usually lie horizontal on top
of one and another. The softer rock layer
usually lies beneath a surface layer of more
resistant rock. The sculpturing effects of
wind abrasion wear them into a furrow
and ridge looking landscape. Insolation
weathering enhances this activity.

Playas:

Playas are by far the most prominent
landforms in the deserts. In basins with
mountains and hills around and along the
drainage is towards the centre of the basin
and due to gradual deposition of sediment
from basin margins a nearly level plain
forms at the centre of the basin. In times
of suffcient water this plain is covered
up by a shallow water body. Such types of
shallow lakes are called as playas where
water is retained only for short duration
due to evaporation and quite often the
playas contain good deposition of salts. The
playa plain covered up by salts is called
alkali flats.
1 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 94.---------------
Explanation:

Depositional Landforms

Wind is a good sorting agent. Depending
upon the velocity of wind different sizes of
grains are moved along the floors by rolling
or Saltation and carried in suspension and
in this process of transportation itself the
materials get sorted. When the wind slows
or begins to die down depending upon
sizes of grains and their critical velocities
the grains will begin to settle. So in
depositional landforms made by wind
good sorting of grains can be found. Sand
accumulations come in a range of sizes and
forms. Deposition may occur as sheets of
sand (dune fields and sand seas) or loess or
as characteristic dunes.

Ripples: Wind ripples are the smallest
Aeolian bed form. They are regular wave
like undulations lying at right-angles to
the prevailing wind direction.

Loess: Loess is terrestrial sediment
composed largely of windblown silt particles
made of quartz. It covers some 5-10 per
cent of the Earth’s land surface much
of it forming a blanket over pre-existing
topography that may be up to 400 m thick.
Loess requires three things:

> asource of silt;
> wind to transport the silt; and

>» a suitable site for deposition and
accumulation

Dunes: Dunes are collections of loose sand
built piece meal by the wind. They usually
range from a few metres across and a
few centimetres high to 2 km across and
400m high. Sand dunes form where there
is a source of sand. Dune sand is usually
composed of quartz which is extremely hard
and doesn’t easily decay. Dune sand grains
are beautifully rounded by abrasion.

1 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 95.---------------
Explanation:

Coastal landforms

The coastline under the constant action
of the waves tides and currents is
undergoing changes from day to day.

Tides affect marine erosion mainly by
extending a line of erosion into a zone of
erosion. Currents help to move eroded
debris and deposit it as silt sand and
gravel along the coasts.


The most powerful agents of marine
erosion are waves. Their origin is due to the
sweeping of winds over the water surface
which sets a series of undulating swells
surging forward.

Sand and gravel loosened fromthe land
are moved by waves to be deposited
along the shore as beaches. This is the
most dominant form of constructive work of
the sea. The eroded material is transported
along the shore of the sea.

Longshore drift is a geological process that
consists of the transportation of sediments
(clay silt sand and shingle) along a coast
parallel to the shoreline whichis dependent
on oblique incoming wind direction.
Oblique incoming wind squeezes water
along the coast and so generates water
current which moves parallel to the coast.
Spits are formed when longshore drift
travels past a point (e.g. river mouth
or re-entrant) where the dominant
drift direction and shoreline do not
veer in the same direction.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 96.---------------
Explanation:

Ground Water

Any limestone or dolomitic region showing
typical landforms produced by the action
of groundwater through the processes of
solution and deposition is called Karst
topography after the typical topography
developed in limestone rocks of Karst
region in the Balkans adjacent to Adriatic
sea.

It is this downward and_ horizontal
movement of water that causes the rocks
to erode. Physical or mechanical removal
of materials by moving groundwater is
insignificant in developing landforms.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 97.---------------
Explanation:

Depositional Landforms

The unassorted coarse and fi ne debris
dropped by the melting glaciers is called
glacial till. Most of the rock fragments in till
are angular to sub angularin form. Streams
form by melting ice at the bottom sides or
lower ends of glaciers. Some amount of
rock debris small enough to be carried by
such melt water streams is washed down
and deposited. Such Glaciofluvial deposits
are called outwash deposits.

Unlike till deposits the outwash deposits
are roughly stratified and assorted. The


rock fragments in outwash deposits are
somewhat rounded at their edges. Some of
the depositional landforms are discussed
below:

A Glaciated Upland

Moraines

They are long ridges of deposits of glacial
till. Terminal moraines are long ridges
of debris deposited at the end (toe) of the
glaciers.

Lateral moraines form along the sides
parallel to the glacial valleys. The lateral
moraines may join a terminal moraine
forming a horse-shoe shaped ridge.

There can be many lateral moraines on
either side in a glacial valley.

These moraines partly or fully owe their
origin to glaciofluvial waters pushing up
materials to the sides of glaciers.

Many valley glaciers retreating rapidly
leave an irregular sheet of till over their
valley floors. Such deposits varying greatly
in thickness and in surface topography are
called ground moraines.

The moraine in the centre of the glacial
valley flanked by lateral moraines
is called medial moraine. They are
imperfectly formed as compared to lateral
moraines. Sometimes medial moraines are
indistinguishable from ground moraines.

Drumlins

These are elongate hills of lodgement till
that are typically wider and higher in the
direction from which the glaciers fl owed.
The elongation direction is parallel to the
glacial flow direction.

Eskers

When glaciers melt in summer the water
flows on the surface of the ice or seeps down


along the margins or even moves through
holes in the ice.

These waters accumulate beneath the
glacier and flow like streams in a channel
beneath the ice. Such streams flow over the
ground (not in a valley cut in the ground)
with ice forming its banks.

Very coarse materials like boulders and
blocks along with some minor fractions of
rock debris carried into this stream settle
in the valley of ice beneath the glacier and
after the ice melts can be found as a sinuous
ridge called esker.

Outwash Plains

The plains at the foot of the glacial
mountains or beyond the limits of
continental ice sheets are covered with
glacio-fluvial deposits in the form of broad
flat alluvial fans which may join to form
outwash plains of gravel silt sand and
clay.

Kettle

When glaciers are rapidly retreating
numerous blocks of ice can become
detached from the main body of the glacier.
If glacial drift is then placed around the ice
a depression on the surface called a kettle
hole can be created when the ice melts.

Kettle holes are commonly found on
moraine and outwash plain deposits. Large
kettle holes that reach below the water
table can form into lakes.

1 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 98.---------------
Explanation:

Moraine

It is a general term applied to rock
fragments gravel sand etc. carried by a
glacier.

Depending on its position the moraine
can be ground lateral medial or terminal
moraine.

The material dropped at the end of valley
glacial in the form of a ridge is called the
terminal moraine.

Each time a glacier treats a fresh terminal
moraine is left at a short distance behind
the first one. The mater deposited at either
of its sides is known as lateral moraine.

When two glaciers join the lateral
moraines also join near their confluence
and are called a medial moraine. Many
Alpine pastures in the Himalayas like the
Marge Kashmir occupy the sites of moraine
deposits of old river valleys.
The excessive load cannot be carried
forward by a glacier deposited on its own
bed or at the base appears as what is known
as ground moraine.

Food fortification in India

Fortification is the addition of key
vitamins and minerals such as iron
iodine zinc Vitamin A & D to staple foods
such as rice milk and salt to improve their
nutritional content. These nutrients may
or may not have been originally present in
the food before processing.

India’s National Nutritional strategy
2017 had listed food fortification as one
of the interventions to address anaemia
vitamin A and iodine deficiencies apart
from supplementation and _ dietary
diversification.

Malnutrition is a prominent issue in India
— 38 per cent of children under five years
are stunted i.e. too short for their age 36
per cent are underweight and 21 per cent
are wasted i.e. too thin for their height
which is a sign of acute under-nutrition.

59 per cent women and 53 per cent children
are anaemic.

The Food Safety and Standards
Authority of India (FSSAI) made
standards for fortification in the Food
Safety and Standards (Fortification of
Foods) Regulations 2018 for five staples
— wheat rice milk oil and salt.


The standards are given for wheat and
rice fortification with iron folic acid
and vitamin B12 the deficiency of which
cause anaemia. Besides other B vitamins
are also added.

Standards are provided for oil and milk
fortification with vitamin A_ and
vitamin D the deficiency of which cause
night blindness and rickets respectively;
and salt fortification with iron along
with iodine to prevent goitre.

The food companies who wish to add
micronutrients to these staples sold in
the packages will also have to follow the
standards set by FSSAI. If the product is
fortified according to the standards the
package will carry an F+ label.

The Union Ministries of Women and
Child Development Human Resource
Development and Consumer Affairs Food
and Public Distribution have mandated
the distribution of fortified wheat
flour rice oil and double fortified salt
in their schemes — Integrated Child
Development Services (ICDS) and Mid-

Statement 2 is incorrect: The Great Barrier
Reef located off Australia’s East Coast is

Supplementary notes:

Coral reefs

Coral reefs are large underwater structures
composed of the skeletons of colonial marine
invertebrates called coral.

The coral species that build reefs are
known as hermatypic or “hard” corals
because they extract calcium carbonate
from seawater to create a hard durable
exoskeleton that protects their soft sac-
like bodies.

Hard corals rely on symbiotic algae
(zooxanthellae) living within their
tissues for nutrition and energy to build
their skeleton.

Soft corals look like colourful plants or
graceful trees and are not reef-building
since they do not produce the hard calcified
skeleton of many reef-building corals.

For Question 105.---------------
Explanation:

The difference between weather and
climate

e Weather is the state of the atmosphere
at a particular place and time as regards
heat cloudiness dryness sunshine wind
rain etc. Whereas the average weather
conditions prevalent from one season to
another in the course of a year over a large
area is known as climate. The average of
these weather conditions is calculated from
the data collected for several years (about
35 years) for a larger area.

e The weather or climate can or cannot
change in a region.

e Generally the climate of temperate
latitudes is far more variable than that
of the tropics. For instance The climate
of the British Isles is so changeable that
many people have said that ‘Britain has
no climate only weather’. Conversely the
climate of Egypt is so static that it makes
a good deal of sense when people say that
‘Egypt has no weather only climate’.

Correct Option: (a)
For Question 106.---------------
Explanation:

Forees Affecting the speed and Direction
of Wind

e The movement of air in the horizontal
direction is called wind.

e The wind are under influence of the
pressure gradient force(PGF) the frictional
force and the Coriolis force.

Pressure Gradient Force (PGF)

e It is the rate of change of pressure with
respect to distance.

e It is perpendicular to the isobars
(parallel lines connecting the same
atmospheric level). Hence PGF is strong

where the isobars are close to each other
and it is weak where the isobars are apart.

e If PGF is high wind speed will be more.

Coriolis force

e The rotation of the earth about its axis
affects the direction of the wind.

e This force is called the Coriolis force (a
pseudo force exerted on a moving object
i.e. wind by the rotating non-inertial frame
observer).

e Itismaximum atthe poles and is zero at the
equator because it is directly proportional
to the angle of latitude.

e The Coriolis force acts perpendicular
to the pressure gradient force. Hence
it does not have a role in wind speed.

e It has a role only in the direction of
wind. In doing so it deflects the wind
to the right direction in the northern
hemisphere and to the left in the southern
hemisphere.

Frictional force

e It is due to friction between the features
(natural and man-made both) of the Earth
and wind.

e It affects the speed of the wind.
e It is greatest at the surface and over the

sea surface it is minimal.

For Question 110.---------------
Explanation:

Atmospheric Pressure

e It is the force per unit area exerted
against a surface by the weight of the
air above that surface.

e In other words it is the weight of a
column of air contained in a unit area
from the mean sea level to the top of


e Therefore at a place if the air is dense for
instance near the Earth’s surface (due to
Gravity) the atmospheric pressure will be
more.

e It is expressed in atm (Atmosphere) Mb
(millibar) and Pa (Pascal).

e It is measured with the help of a mercury
barometer or the aneroid barometer.

e At sea level the average atmospheric
pressure is 1 atm or 1012 Mb or 1012
hPa(kilo Pascal).

Variations of Atmospheric Pressure

e As the Pressure depends on the number of
air molecules present at any place it varies
both vertically as well as horizontally.

e This variation of the Atmospheric Pressure
has been playing a very important role in
Weather and Climate.

e Its variation is the main cause of air
motion/wind.

Vertical variation

e The pressure decreases with height because
air gets thinner.

e The average decrease is about 1 Mb
per 10m increase in elevation subject
to other factors such as Temperature local
topography continentality etc.

e Therefore if the surface Atmospheric
Pressure at any place is 1000 Mb then
the Pressure at 1 km above the surface
will be (1000 — 100) Mb i.e. 900mb.

e Despite the high vertical pressure gradient
there is weak upward wind because the
pressure gradient gets weakened by
Gravitational force.

Horizontal Variation

e The horizontal variation of the Pressure
depends on the differential heating
(insolation) of the surface which causes the
differential air volumes.

e These variations are highly significant in
terms of wind direction and speed. Though
the direction and speed depend also on
Frictional force and Coriolis force.

e Horizontal distribution of pressure is
studied by drawing isobars (lines connecting
places having equal pressure) at constant
levels.

Correct Option: (d)
For Question 111.---------------
Explanation:

Ionosphere

e The ionosphere is a very active part of
the atmosphere and it grows and shrinks


depending on the energy it absorbs from the
Sun. The name ionosphere comes from the
fact that gases in these layers are excited
by solar radiation to form ions which have
an electrical charge.

e Because of the high energy from the Sun
and from cosmic rays the atoms in this area
have been stripped of one or more of their
electrons or “ionized” and are therefore
positively charged. The ionized
electrons behave as free particles. The
Sun’s upper atmosphere the corona is
very hot and produces a constant stream
of plasma and UV and X-rays that flow
out from the Sun and affect or ionize the
Earth’s ionosphere. Only half the Earth’s
ionosphere is being ionized by the Sun at
any time.

e Itis not a separate layer but is present in
both the layers of the mesosphere and the
thermosphere.

e The ionosphere is composed of three
main parts viz. the D E and F regions.
The electron density is highest in
the upper or F region. The F region
exists during both daytime and nighttime.
During the day it is ionized by solar
radiation during the night by cosmic rays.
The D region disappears during the night
compared to the daytime and the E region
becomes weakened.

e During the night the ionosphere has only
the F and E layers. During the daytime
the Sun’s X-ray and UV light increase the
ionization of the ionosphere creating the D
and enhancing the E layers and splitting
the F region into 2 layers. Thus the size
of the ionosphere is not fixed.

Correct Option: (c)
For Question 112.---------------
Explanation:

Thermosphere

e The thermosphere lies between the
exosphere and the mesosphere. “Thermo”
means heat and the temperature in this
layer can reach up to 4500 degrees
Fahrenheit.

e There aren’t enough gas molecules to
convectional transfer the heat in this
layer.

e This also means there aren’t enough
molecules for sound waves to travel
through.

e The thermosphere is home to the
International Space Station and the
low Earth orbit satellites.


Correct Option: (d)
For Question 113.---------------
Explanation:

Redistribution of water

e Water essential for life on the Earth is
present in all of its forms viz. Solid liquid
and gas.

e Likewise its redistribution is also

necessary.

e Itisredistributed by various processes
such as evaporation precipitation
transpiration condensation Earth’s
rotation volcanic eruption etc. and
by various agents including wind.

Evaporation

e It is the process by which water is
vaporized that occurs on the surface
of a liquid as it changes into the gas
phase. Heat is the main cause of this
process.

Transpiration

e It is essentially an evaporation of water
from plant leaves surface.

Condensation

e Itis the process by which water vapor
transforms into liquid form.

e The cloud making is a_ kind of
condensation.
Volcanic Eruption:

e Itis a process by which the magma along
with various gases including water vapor
from the asthenosphere comes out on the
Earth’s surface.

Wind

e It is the horizontal movement of air along
the decreasing Pressure Gradient Force

(PGF).

e Wind facilitates the movement of water
vapor.

e Further Wind the most important factor of
the Ocean Current.

Correct Option: (c)
For Question 114.---------------
Explanation:
Clouds

e Cloud is a mass of minute water droplets
or tiny crystals of ice formed by the
condensation of the water vapor in free air
at considerable elevation.

e As the clouds are formed at some height


over the surface of the earth they take
various shapes.

e According to their shape density
opaqueness etc. clouds are of four types
viz. cirrus cumulus stratus and nimbus.

Cirrus Clouds

e These clouds are formed at high altitudes
(8000 - 12000m).

e They are thin and detached clouds having
a feathery appearance.

Cumulus Clouds
e Cumulus clouds look like cotton wool.

e They are generally formed at middle height
of 4000- 7000 m.

Stratus Clouds

e These clouds are layered clouds
covering large portions of the sky.

e These clouds are generally formed either
due to loss of heat or the mixing of air
masses with different temperatures.

Nimbus Clouds

e Nimbus clouds are black or dark
gray.

e They form at middle levels or very
near to the surface of the earth.

e These are extremely dense and opaque
to the rays of the sun.

Correct Option: (c)
For Question 115.---------------
Explanation:

Cloud formation

e The formation of cloud starts from
evaporation. By this the humidity of the
air increases.

e After this the condensation takes place.

e First air filled with moisture (due to
evaporation) rise up to a point where its
relative humidity should be more than the
surrounding air.

e Then if the temperature of air is
below the dew point (at that place)
the moisture present in the air gets
condensed around condensation
nuclei (suspended microparticles).

e Condensation takes place when the dew
point is lower than the freezing point as
well as higher than the freezing point.
That is the condensation does not
depend on the freezing point. Rather
it depends on the condition that the
temperature of the air must be below

ceRJSCORE

the Dew point.

After this the condensation can take
various forms like clouds dew frost etc.

Frost forms on cold surfaces when the
dew point is at or below the freezing
point.

For the formation of dew it is
necessary that the dew point is above
the freezing point.

 Correct option: (d)

For Question 116.---------------
Explanation:

Types of Precipitation

Conventional Rain: The air on being
heated becomes light and rises up
in convection currents. As it rises it
expands and loses heat and consequently
condensation takes place and cumulous
clouds are formed. With thunder and
lightning heavy rainfall takes place
but this does not last long. Such rain
is common in the summer or in the hotter
part of the day. It is very common in the
equatorial regions and interior parts of the
continents particularly in the northern
hemisphere.

Orographic Rain: When the saturated
air mass comes across a mountain it is
forced to ascend and as it rises it expands;
the temperature falls and the moisture is
condensed. The chief characteristic of this
sort of rain is that the windward slopes
receive greater rainfall. After giving rain
on the windward side when these winds
reach the other slope they descend and
their temperature rises. Then their capacity
to take in moisture increases and hence
these leeward slopes remain rainless and
dry. The area situated on the leeward side
which gets less rainfall is known as the
rain-shadow area. It is also known as
the relief rain.

Cyclonic Rain: This type of precipitation
occurs along the frontal zones of
convergence particularly at the Inter-
Tropical Convergence Zone and at the
polar fronts.

For Question 117.---------------
Explanation:

Factors

Controlling Temperature

Distribution

The temperature of the air at any place is
influenced by the following factors:

» The Latitude: The temperature of
a place depends on the insolation


received. Since the insolation
varies according to the latitude the
temperature also varies accordingly.

>» The Altitude: The atmosphere
is indirectly heated by terrestrial
radiation from below. Therefore the
places near the sea-level record a
higher temperature than the places
situated at higher elevations. In other
words the temperature generally
decreases with increasing height.

» Distance from the Sea or the
continentality: Compared to land
the sea gets heated slowly and loses
heat slowly. Land heats up and
cools down quickly. Therefore the
variation in temperature over the sea
is less compared to land. The places
situated near the sea come under
the moderating influence of the sea
and land breezes which moderate the
temperature.

» Air-Mass and Ocean Currents: The
places which come under the influence
of warm air-masses experience higher
temperature and the places that
come under the influence of cold air
masses experience low temperatures.
Similarly the places located on the
coast where the warm ocean currents
flow record higher temperatures than
the places located on the coast where

the cold currents flow.

1 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 118.---------------
Explanation:

Atmosphere

Up to the height of 80 km in the
atmosphere the homogeneity of
the proportion of various gases is
present. Hence this layer is called the
homosphere. Beyond the homosphere
there are atomic layers of nitrogen
oxygen helium and hydrogen. The
region of heterogeneity is called
heterosphere.

The exosphere extends from 640 km to
1000 km of height from the sea level.
Electrically charged particles are
found abundantly in this layer too
and there are separate layers of N O He
and H. The atmosphere becomes rarefied
at the height of 1000 km and it ultimately
merges with the space beyond the height
of 1000 km.

1 Correct option: (b)

For Question 119.---------------
Explanation:
Inversion of Temperature

Ideally with an increase in _ height
temperature decreases. However there are
certain conditions when the temperature
increases with height instead of decreasing
which is contrary to the ideal situation.
This contradictory phenomenon is called
temperature inversion.

It occurs in the troposphere stratosphere
and thermosphere.

Under normal situations inthetroposphere
the temperature of the atmosphere
decreases with an increase in the altitude
at the rate of 1 degree for every 165 meters
which are called the normal lapse rate.

In the troposphere a long winter night
with clear skies and still air is an ideal
situation for inversion. The heat of the day
radiated off during the night and by early
morning hours the earth is cooler than the
air above. Over polar areas a temperature
inversion is normal throughout the year.

Smoke and dust particles get collected
beneath the inversion layer and spread
horizontally to fill the lower strata of the
atmosphere. Dense fogs in the mornings are
common occurrences especially during the
winter season. This inversion commonly
lasts for a few hours until the sun comes
up and beings to warm the earth.

In the stratosphere and thermosphere the
temperature increases with height due to
the presence of the ozone layer and ions in
these layers correspondingly.

For Question 120.---------------
Explanation:

Reasons for the Season

A season is a period of the year that is
distinguished by special climate conditions.
The four seasons-spring summer fall
and winter-follow one another regularly.
Each has its own light temperature and
weather patterns that repeat yearly.

The seasons are caused by the tilt of
the Earth’s rotational axis away or
toward the sun as it travels through
its year-long path around the sun. All
the other reasons are there but they have
only supplementary effects.

In June when the Northern Hemisphere
is tilted toward the sun the sun’s rays
hit it for a greater part of the day than in
winter. This means it gets more hours of
daylight. In December when the Northern
Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun
with fewer hours of daylight. This causes
the seasons on the Earth.


1 Correct option: (c)

For Question 121.---------------
Explanation:

Albedo of the Earth

Albedo is a measure of the reflectivity of a
surface. The albedo effect when applied to
the Earth is a measure of how much of the
Sun’s energy is reflected back into space.
Overall the Earth’s albedo has a cooling
effect. About one-third of that energy
from the Sun is reflected by the Earth
back into space.

If Earth was completely covered in ice
its albedo would be about 84 meaning
it would reflect most (84 percent) of
the sunlight that hit it. On the other
hand if Earth was covered by a dark
green forest canopy the albedo would
be about 14 (most of the sunlight
would get absorbed). Thus increasing
green cover decreases the albedo of
the Earth.

Changes in ice cover cloudiness airborne
pollution or land cover (from forest to
farmland for instance) all have subtle
effects on global albedo.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 122.---------------
Explanation:

Composition of the Atmosphere

The atmosphere is a mixture of many gases
water vapour and dust particles. It also
contains huge amount of solid and liquid
particles collectively known as “aerosols”.
Pure dry air consists mainly of Nitrogen
Oxygen Argon and Carbon dioxide
Hydrogen Helium and Ozone. Besides
water vapour dust particles smoke salts
are also present in air in varying quantities.
The composition of atmosphere upto an
altitude of about 90 km is uniform in terms
of three major gases - Nitrogen Oxygen
and Argon. This layer is generally called
homosphere. Above 90 km the composition
begins to change with progressive increase
in the lighter gases. This layer is known as
heterosphere.

Gases

Nitrogen and Oxygen comprise 99% of
the total volume of the atmosphere. But
they are climatically of little consequences.
Nitrogen doesn’t easily enter into chemical
union with other substances but gets fixed
into the soil. It serves mainly as diluents
and regulates combustion.


It is available to the organisms through
plants. Plants convert the nitrogen into
various usable forms through the process
of nitrogen fixation. Various industries like
fertilizer industries explosive industries
etc. usethenitrogenavailablein atmosphere
as raw material. So it is of great biological
and economical importance.

Oxygen combines with all the elements and
is most combustible.

Carbon dioxide constitutes a small
percentage of the atmosphere. It is
transparent to the incoming shortwave
but is capable of trapping long wave solar
radiation. It can absorb heat and allow the
lower atmosphere to be warmed up by heat
radiation coming from the sun and from
the earth’s surface. It is largely responsible
for the greenhouse effect.

However increase in its concentration
culminates to rise in temperature thus
global warming.

It is equally important in supporting the
life as well as deterring it. CO2 is found in
the atmosphere as free gas as well as in the
dissolved from.

Water Vapour

Water vapor is a variable factor which
ranges from 0 to 4% depending on various
factors of the region like atmospheric
circulation of wind temperature supply
of moisture vegetation concentration
of population and human activities
etc. Water vapour controls to a great
extent the climatic condition of the area.
Temperature is the primary factor which
controls the presence of water vapour.
So it goes on decreasing towards the
pole from equator. It’s concentration is
in the lower strata of the atmosphere upto
the height of 5 km. The moisture content
of the atmosphere creates several forms of
condensation and precipitation e.g. clouds
fogs dew rainfall frost hailstorm ice
snowfall etc.

Particulate Matter

The particulate matters present in the
atmosphere includes dust particles salt
particles pollen smoke and soot volcanic
ashes etc. They are kept in suspension in
the atmosphere. When the smoke is mixed
with the fog it forms smog. It persists in
the atmosphere for longer time than the
fog and reduces the visibility of the region
to a great extent sometimes even to few
metres bringing the traUcs to a standstill
and is responsible for fatal accidents. They

 

 

 

 


are the main cause of haze formation.

1 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 123.---------------
Explanation:

Factors Affecting Climate

Latitude or Distance from the Equator:
The places near the equator are warmer
than the places which are far away from
it. This is because the rays of the sun fall
vertical on the equator and slanting in the
temperate and polar regions. Therefore
lower the latitude higher is the temperature
and vice versa.

Altitude or the Height from the mean
sea level: The temperature decreases with
increase in height as atmosphere is heated
from below.

Continentality or the Distance from
the Sea: The water is a bad conductor of
heat i.e. It takes longer time to heat and
longer time to cool. Due to this moderating
effect of the sea places near the coast
have low range of temperature and high
humidity. The places in the interior of the
continent do not experience moderating
effect of the sea. These places have extreme
temperatures. Mumbai has relatively lower
temperature and higher rainfall than
Nagpur although both are almost situated
on the same latitude.

Nature of the Prevailing Winds: The
on-shore winds bring the moisture from the
sea and cause rainfall on the area through
which they pass. The off -shore winds
coming from the land are dry and help in
evaporation. In India the on-shore summer
monsoon winds bring rains while off -shore
winter monsoon winds are generally dry.

Cloud Cover: In areas generally of
cloudless sky as in deserts temperature
even under shade is very high because
of the hot day time sunshine. At night
this heat radiates back from the ground
very rapidly. It results in a large diurnal
range in temperature. On the other hand
under cloudy sky and heavy rainfall
at Thiruvananthapuram the range of
temperature is very small.

Ocean Currents: Ocean waters move
from one place to another partly as an
attempt to equalize temperature and
density of water. The warm ocean currents
raise the temperature of the coast and
sometimes bring rainfall while the cold
currents lower the temperature and create
fog near the coast. Port Bergen in Norway
is free from ice even in winter due to warm
North Atlantic Drift while Port Quebec
in Canada remains frozen during winter
months due to chilling effect of the Cold
Labrador Current in spite of the fact that
Port Quebec is situated in much lower
latitude than Port Bergen.

Direction of Mountain Chains: The
mountain chains act as natural barrier
for the wind. The on-shore moisture laden
winds are forced to rise after striking
against the mountain; and give heavy
rainfall on the windward side. These winds
descending on the leeward side cause very
low rainfall. The great Himalayas check
the moisture laden monsoon winds from
crossing over to Tibet. This mountain
chain also checks biting polar cold winds
from entering into India. This is the
reason for which northern plains of India
get rains while Tibet remains a perpetual
rain shadow area with lesser amount of
rainfall.

Slope: The concentration of heat being
more on the gentler slope raises the
temperature of air above them. Its lesser
concentration along steeper slopes lowers
the temperature. At the same time
mountain slopes facing the sun are warmer
than the slopes which are away from the
sun’s rays. The southern slopes of Himalaya
are warmer than the northern slopes.

The Nature of the Soil and Vegetation
Cover: The nature of soil depends upon its
texture structure and composition. These

qualities vary from soil to soil.

1 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 124.---------------
Explanation:

Upper Air Inversion

Upper air inversion is of two type’s viz.
G) thermal upper air inversion and (ii)
mechanical upper air inversion.

The thermal upper air inversion is caused
by the presence of ozone layer lying between
the heights of 15 to 35 km (even up to 80
km) in the stratosphere.

The mechanical inversion of temperature is
caused at higher heights in the atmosphere
due to subsidence of air and turbulence
and convertible mechanisms. Mechanical
inversion caused by the subsidence of
air currents is generally associated with
the anticyclones conditions. This type of
inversion of temperature is very common in
the middle latitude where high pressures
are characterized by sinking air.

The pole wards regions of the winds are
also characterized by high pressure caused


by the subsidence of air resulting into
mechanical inversion of temperature.

The temperature inversion causes
stability in the atmosphere. This is
the reason that the poleward parts of
trade winds are characterized by arid

conditions.

1 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 125.---------------
Explanation:

Atmospheric Humidity & Rainfall

Condensation

Condensation is the process by which
atmospheric water vapour changes into
water or ice crystals. It is just reverse
of the process of evaporation. When the
temperature of saturated air falls below
dew point the air cannot hold the amount
of humidity which it was holding earlier at
a higher temperature. This extra amount
of humidity changes into water droplets
or crystals of ice depending upon the
temperature at which condensation takes
place.

The temperature of the air falls in two
ways. Firstly cooling occurs around very
small particles of freely floating air when
it comes in contact with some colder object.
Secondly loss in air temperature takes
place on a massive scale due to rising of air
to higher altitudes.

The condensation takes place around
the smoke salt and dust particles which
attract water vapour to condense around
them. They are called hygroscopic nuclei.
When the relative humidity of an air is
high a slight cooling is required to bring
the temperature down below dew point.

But when the relative humidity is low and
the temperature of the air is high a lot of
cooling of the air will be necessary to bring
the temperature down below dew point.
Thus condensation is directly related
to the relative humidity and the rate
of cooling.

Condensation takes place in two situations
firstly when dew point is below freezing
point or below 0°C and secondly when it is
above freezing point. In this way the forms
of condensation may be classified into two
groups:

>» Frost snow and some clouds are
formed when dew point is below
freezing point.

>» Dew mist fog smog and some clouds
are formed when dew point is above


The forms of condensation may also be
classified on the basis of place where it is
occurring for example on the ground or
natural objects such as grass blades and
leaves of the plants or trees in the air close
to the earth’s surface or at some height in
the troposphere.

Dew: When the atmospheric moisture is
condensed and deposited in the form of
water droplets on cooler surface of solid
objects such as grass blades leaves of
plants and trees and stones it is termed
as dew. Condensation in dew form occurs
when there is clear sky little or no wind
high relative humidity and cold long nights.
These conditions lead to greater terrestrial
radiation and the solid objects become cold
enough to bring the temperature of air
down below dew point. In this process the
extra moisture of the air gets deposited on
these objects. Dew is formed when dew
point is above freezing point.

Frost: When the dew point is below freezing
point under above mentioned conditions
the condensation of extra moisture takes
place in the form of very minute particles
of ice crystals. It is called frost. In this
process the air moisture condenses directly
in the form of tiny crystal of ice. This form
of condensation is disastrous for standing
crops such as potato peas pulses grams
etc. It also creates problems for road
transport system.

Mist and Fog: When condensation takes
place in the air near the earth’s surface in
the form of tiny droplets of water hanging
and floating in the air it is called mist.
In mist the visibility is more than one
kilometer and less than two kilometers.
But when the visibility is reduced to less
than one kilometer it is called fog. Ideal
conditions for the formation of mist and fog
are clear sky calm and cold winter nights.

Smog: Smog is a fog that has been polluted
and discoloured by smoke dust carbon

fumes. Smog frequently occurs in large

respiratory illness.

Clouds: Clouds are visible aggregates of
water droplets ice particles or a mixture
of both along with varying amounts of dust
particles. A typical cloud contains billions
of droplets having diameters on the order
01 to 02 mm; yet liquid or solid water
accounts for less than 10 parts per million
of the cloud volume. Clouds are generally
classified on the basis of their general form

or appearance and altitude.

For Question 126.---------------
Explanation:

Conditions of Occurrence of Precipitation

Precipitation is the result of a complex
series of micro-physical processes within a
cloud.

Precipitation may form as a result of
collision and coalescence within a cloud.

Precipitation may form where ice crystals
and water droplets coexist within a cloud;
this precipitation mechanism is known as
the Bergeron-Findeisen process.

Precipitation-size droplets do not form
instantly. It takes time for the droplets to
grow insize. Only ifthe conditions favorable
to droplet growth last for a suUcient length
of time then only precipitation will reach
the ground.

For Question 127.---------------
Explanation:

Gases

Nitrogen and Oxygen comprise 99% of the
total volume of the atmosphere. But they
are climatically of little consequences.
Nitrogen doesn’t easily enter into chemical
union with other substances but gets fixed
into the soil. It serves mainly as diluents
and regulates combustion.

It is available to the organisms through
plants. Plants convert the nitrogen
into various usable forms through the
process of nitrogen fixation. Various
industries like fertilizer industries
explosive industries etc. use the nitrogen
available in atmosphere as raw material.
So it is of great biological and economical
importance.

Oxygen combines with all the elements
and is most combustible.

Carbon dioxide constitutes a small
percentage of the atmosphere. It is
transparent to the incoming shortwave
but is capable of trapping long wave
solar radiation. It can absorb heat and
allow the lower atmosphere to be warmed
up by heat radiation coming from the sun
and from the earth’s surface. It is largely
responsible for the greenhouse effect.

However increase in its concentration
culminates to rise in temperature thus
global warming.

It is equally important in supporting the
life as well as deterring it. CO2 is found in
the atmosphere as free gas as well as in the
dissolved from.

Explanation:

World pressure belts

 

There are distinctly identifiable zones of
homogeneous horizontal pressure regimes
or ‘pressure belts’. On the earth’s surface
there are in all seven pressure belts.

These are Equatorial low sub-tropical
highs(2) the sub-polar lows(2) and the
polar highs(2).

Polar high

Subpolar
low <=

Equatorial low: its width may vary between
5°N and 5°S and 20°N and 20°S depending
on the apparent movement of the Sun. This
belt happens to be the zone of convergence
of trade winds from two hemispheres from
sub-tropical high-pressure belts. This belt
is also called the Doldrums because of
the extremely calm air movements.

Sub-tropical highs: About 30°N. and S.
occur the Sub-Tropical High-Pressure
Belts where the air is comparatively dry
and the winds are calm and light. It is a
region of descending air currents or
wind divergence and anticyclones. It
is frequently referred to as the Horse
Latitudes.

cehISCORE

Sub-polar lows: Around the latitudes 60°N.
and S. are two Tem~perate Low-Pressure
Belts which are also zones of convergence
with cyclonic activity. The sub-polar
low-pressure areas are best developed
over the oceans where temperature
differences between summer and winter
are negligible.

Polar highs: At the North and South
Poles 90°N. and S. where temperatures
are permanently low are the Polar High-
Pressure Belts.

For Question 134.---------------
Explanation:

Conditions favorable for the formation of
the Tropical cyclones

Large surface area with Sea Surface
Temperature higher than 27°C.

Presence of Coriolis force that’s why the

Cyclones originate at some distance from
the ITCZ (Inter Tropical Convergence
Zone).

Low-pressure areas at the sea surface i.e.
a cyclonic convergence area and Upper
divergence area above the sea.

Small variations in the vertical wind
speed.

Just having warm water aloneis not enough
for the formation of a tropical cyclone.
There also needs to be a disturbance in the
atmosphere such as:

>» Easterly Waves: Also called tropical
waves this is an inverted trough of low
pressure moving generally westward
in the tropical easterlies. A trough
is defined as a region of relative low
pressure. The majority of tropical
cyclones form from easterly waves.

>» West African Disturbance Line
(WADL): This is a line of convection
that forms over West Africa and moves
into the Atlantic Ocean. WADL’s
usually move faster than tropical
waves.

>» TUTT: A TUTT (Tropical Upper
Tropospheric Trough) isa trough or
cold core low in the upper atmosphere
which produces convection. On
occasion one of these develops into a
warm-core tropical cyclone.

>» Old Frontal Boundary: Remnants
of a polar front can become lines of
convection and occasionally generate a
tropical cyclone. In the Atlantic Ocean
storms this will occur early or late in

 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 135.---------------
Explanation:

Tropical Cyclones

Tropical Cyclones are violent storms that
originate over the seas in the Low-Pressure
belt of the tropical areas and move eastward
over to the coastal areas.

They bring about large scale destruction
caused by violent winds very heavy rainfall
and storm surges which make them one of
the most devastating natural calamities.

They are known as Cyclones in the
Indian Ocean Hurricanes in the Atlantic
Typhoons in the Western Pacific and South
China Sea and Willy-willies in Western
Australia.

They originate only over the seas
because of the need for continuous moisture
to energize the Cyclones regularly. This is
why they dissipate once reaching the land.

They are violent because of the energy
coming from the condensation process in
cumulonimbus clouds surrounding the
Cyclones.

They move from east to west because
they are facilitated by the Trade
wind

Temperate Cyclone

This system develops in the mid and high
latitude (around 60° latitude) along the
polar front (boundary between the warm
air and cold air).

As the polar front develops over
the entire polar frontal system this
cyclone affects a much larger area of
around 2000 km. Also it develops over
land and sea both as far as there is a
frontal system.


It moves from west to east due to the
influence of Westerlies.

Explanation:

The planetary winds

northeast
trades

Within the pattern of permanent pressure
belts on the globe winds tend to blow from
the high-pressure belts to the low-pressure
belts as the planetary winds.

Instead of blowing directly from one
pressure belt to another however the effect
of the rotation of the earth (Coriolis Force)
tends to deflect the direction of the winds.
In the northern hemisphere winds are
deflected to their right and in the southern
hemisphere to their left this is known as
Ferrel’s Law of Deflection.

For this reason winds blowing out from
the Sub Tropical High-Pressure Belt
in the northern hemisphere towards
the Equatorial Low become North-East
Trade Winds and those in the southern
hemisphere become the South East Trade
winds.

The westerlies are the winds blowing
from the sub-tropical high-pressure

pressure belts. They blow from southwest
to north-east in the northern hemisphere
and north-west to south-east in the
southern hemisphere. The westerlies are
best developed between 40° and 65°S
latitudes. These latitudes are often called
Roaring Forties Furious Fifties and
Shrieking Sixties.

The Polar easterlies are dry cold prevailing
winds blowing from north-east to south-

Explanation:

Jet Stream

Subtropical
Jet Stream 9

Jet Stream

Jet streams are relatively narrow (50
-150 km) bands of strong wind in the
upper levels of the atmosphere below
the Tropopause.

The winds blow from west to east in jet
streams due to the Earth’s rotation but
the flow often shifts to the north and south.
Jet streams follow the boundaries between
hot and cold air.

When the temperature contrast is
maximum jet stream flows in near straight
path. But when temperature contrast
reduces the jet stream starts to follow a
meandering path.

As the difference in temperature
increases between the two locations
the strength of the wind increases.
Therefore the regions around 30° N/S
and 50°-60° N/S are also regions where
the wind in the upper atmosphere
is the strongest. These are called
Subtropical Jet Streams and Polar
Jet correspondingly. Near poles or
equator these streams are weak in
nature.

The meandering jet streams are called
Rossby Waves. Rossby waves are formed
when polar air moves toward the Equator
while tropical air is moving poleward.

Explanation:

Tertiary Winds or Local Winds

Local differences in temperature and
pressure produce local winds. Such winds
are local in extent and are confined to the
lowest levels of the troposphere. Some
examples of local winds are discussed
below.

Warm winds

Sirocco is a hot dry and dusty wind
that originates in the Sahara Desert.

After passing over the Mediterranean
sea it absorbs moisture and causes
cool wet weather in Europe.

Sirocco is so prominent that it is called
by many other local names such as Chili
in Tunisia Ghibli in Libya Leveche in
Spain Khamsin in Egypt ad Malta. In the
Adriatic and Aegean Sea this hot wind is
better known as Gharbi.

Foehn is a strong hot gusty dry and
warm wind of local importance in the
Alps. It helps animal grazing by melting
snow and aids the ripening of grapes.

Chinook is a hot wind of the Rockies
that keeps the grasslands clear of snow
during much of the winter.

The Zonda (or Sondo) is a hot and dry
wind of foehn type on the eastern slopes
of the Andes in central Argentina.

Cold winds

Mistral is very cold and dry with a high
speed of the Alps that brings blizzards into
southern France.

from the west southwest or south on the
pampas in the south of Brazil Argentina

Valley Breeze and Mountain Breeze

e Any wind blowing down an incline is
katabatic wind. If the wind is warm it is
called a Foehn or Chinook if cold it may
be a fall wind such as Bora or a gravity
wind.

e Any wind blowing up a steep incline or
mountain is known as Anabatic wind.

e Inmountainous regions during the day the
slopes get heated up and air moves upslope
and to fill the resulting gap the air from the
valley blows up the valley. Thus it is an
anabatic wind.

e During the night the slopes get cooled
and the dense air descends into the
valley as the mountain wind or the
katabatic wind.

For Question 140.---------------
Explanation:

Atmospheric circulation

e Atmospheric circulation when examined
using a simplified two-dimensional view
is dominated by two major features. The
first is a large feature called the Hadley
cell which lifts air in the ITCZ moves

 


it at high altitudes towards the poles
and sinks it again to the surface in the
subtropical regions. The second feature is
a very strong river of air known as the jet
stream that flows from west to east in the
middle latitudes of each hemisphere. The
meanders of the jet stream produce the
storm tracks that are the major weather
makers in the midlatitude regions.

e The interaction between atmospheric
circulation in the tropics and sub-tropics
and cloud structure is highly correlated.
Interestingly changes in the circulation
and the consequent shifts of cloud
cover lead to differing warming/
cooling effects in the northern and
southern hemispheres.

For Question 141.---------------
Explanation:

Mediterranean Type

e The Warm Temperate Western Margin
Climate is found in relatively few areas
in the world. They are entirely confined to
the western portion of continental masses
between 30° and 45° north and south of the
equator.

e The basic cause of this type of climate is
the shifting of the wind belts. Though the
area around the Mediterranean Sea has the
greatest extent of this type of ‘winter rain
climate’ and gives rise to the more popular
name Mediterranean Climate. Other
Mediterranean regions include California
(around San Francisco) the south-western
tip of Africa (around Cape Town) southern
Australia (in southern Victoria and around
Adelaide bordering the St. Vincent and
Spencer Gulfs) and south-west Australia
(Swanland).

e The Mediterranean type of climate is
characterized by very distinctive climatic
features - a warm summer with off-shore
trades a concentration of rainfall in winter
with onshore westerlies bright sunny
weather with hot dry summers and wet
mild winters and the prominence of local
winds around the Mediterranean Sea
(Sirocco Mistral). Since all regions with
a Mediterranean climate are near large
bodies of water temperatures are generally
moderate with a comparatively small range

chISCORE

of temperature between the winter low
and summer high. Areas with this climate
receive almost all of their yearly rainfall
during the winter season and may go the
summer without having any significant
precipitation.

Trees with small broad leaves are widely
spaced and never very tall. Though there
are many branches they are short and
carry few leaves. The absence of shade is
a distinct feature of Mediterranean lands.
Growth is slow in the cooler and wetter
season even though more rain comes in
winter. The warm bright summers and
cool moist winters enable a wide range of
crops to be cultivated. The Mediterranean
lands are also known as the world’s orchard
lands. A wide range of citrus fruits such
as oranges lemons limes citrons and
grapefruit are grown. Wine production is
another specialty of the Mediterranean
countries because the best wine is
essentially made from grapes. Some 85
percent of grapes produced go into wine.
The long sunny summer allows the grapes
to ripen and then they are handpicked.

The area is important for fruit
cultivation cereal growing wine-making
and agricultural industries as well as
engineering and mining.

For Question 142.---------------
Explanation:

The

Cool Temperate Western Margin

(British Type) Climate

The cool temperate western margins are
under the permanent influence of the
Westerlies all round the year. They are also
regions of much cyclonic activity typical of
Britain and are thus said to experience the
British type of climate. From Britain the
climatic belt stretches far inland into the
lowlands North-West Europe including
such regions as northern and western
France Belgium the Netherlands
Denmark western Norway and also north-
western Iberia. In the southern hemisphere
the climate is experienced in southern
Chile Tasmania and most parts of New
Zealand particularly in South Island.

The mean annual temperatures are usually
between 5°C and 15°C. The annual range of
temperature is small. Summers are in fact
never very warm. Monthly temperatures of
over 18°C even in mid-summer are rare.

The British type of climate has adequate
rainfall throughout the year with a
tendency towards a slight winter or autumn
maximum from cyclonic sources. Since the


rain-bearing winds come from the west
the western margins have the heaviest
rainfall. The amount decreases eastwards
with increasing distance from the sea.

The natural vegetation of this climatic
type is deciduous forest. The trees shed
their leaves in the cold season. This is
an adaptation for protecting themselves
against the winter snow and frost. Shedding
begins in autumn the ‘fall’ season during
which the leaves fall and are scattered by
the winds. Some of the more common species
include oak elm ash birch beech poplar
and hornbeam. Unlike the equatorial
forests the deciduous trees occur in pure
stands and have greater lumbering value
from the commercial point of view. The
deciduous hardwoods are excellent for both
fuel and industrial purposes.

The region differs from many others in its
unprecedented industrial advancement.
The countries are concerned in the
production of machinery chemicals textiles
and other manufactured articles rather
than agriculture fishing or lumbering
though these activities are well represented
in some of the countries. Fishing is
particularly important in Britain Norway
and British Columbia. A very large part of
the deciduous woodlands have been cleared
for fuel timber or agriculture.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 143.---------------
Explanation:

Humidity

Water vapor present in the air is known as
humidity. It is expressed quantitatively in
different ways.

The actual amount of water vapor
present in the atmosphere is known as
the absolute humidity. It is the weight
of water vapor per unit volume of air and
is expressed in terms of grams per cubic
meter.

The ability ofthe air to hold water vapor
depends entirely on itstemperature. As
warm air can hold more water vapor than
cool air the relative humidity decreases
with increasing temperatures.

The percentage of moisture present in
the atmosphere as compared to its full
capacity at a given temperature is known
as the relative humidity. With the change
of air temperature the capacity to retain
moisture increases or decreases and the
relative humidity is also affected. It is
greater over the oceans and least over
the continents.

For Question 144.---------------
Explanation:

Desert formation

    
 
 

Deserts are regions of scanty rainfall which
may be like the hot deserts of the Saharan
type; or temperate as are the mid-latitude
deserts like the Gobi.

The aridity of the hot deserts is
mainly due to the effects of off-shore
Trade Winds hence they are also
called Trade Wind Deserts. Hot
moist air rises into the atmosphere near
the Equator. As the air rises it cools and
drops its moisture as heavy tropical rains.
The resulting cooler drier air mass moves
away from the Equator. As it approaches
the tropics the air descends and warms
up again. The descending air hinders the
formation of clouds so very little rain falls
on the land below. The major hot deserts
of the world are located on the western
coasts of continents between latitudes 15°
and 30°N. and 8S. Example: Sahara Desert
Great Australian Desert Arabian Desert
Iranian Desert Thar Desert Kalahari and
Namib Deserts etc.

Amongst the mid-latitude deserts

many are found on plateaux and are at a
considerable distance from the sea. These
are the Gobi Turkestan and Patagonian
Deserts. The Patagonian Desert is more
due to its rain-shadow position on the
leeward side of the lofty Andes than to
continentality.

Cold ocean currents contribute to the
formation of coastal deserts. Air blowing
toward shore chilled by contact with cold
water produces a layer of fog. This heavy
fog drifts onto land. Although humidity
is high the atmospheric changes that
normally cause rainfall are not present.

Rainshadow deserts exist near the leeward
slopes of some mountain ranges. Leeward
slopes face away from prevailing winds.

Parts of the Arctic and the Antarctic are
classified as deserts. These polar deserts
contain great quantities of water but most


of it is locked in glaciers and ice sheets
year-round. So despite the presence of
millions of liters of water there is actually
little available for plants and animals.

For Question 145.---------------
Explanation:

Sudan type of Climate

The Sudan Climate is a transitional type
of climate found between the equatorial
forests and the trade wind hot deserts. It
is confined within the tropics and is best
developed in the Sudan where the dry and
wet seasons are most distinct hence its
name the Sudan Climate.

The prevailing winds of the region are
the Trade Winds which bring rain to
the coastal districts. They are strongest
in the summer but are relatively dry by the
time they reach the continental interiors
or the western coasts of the continents
so that grass and scattered short trees
predominate.

Rainfall is low to moderate. Grass is not
nutritious as such hence dairy farming is
not well developed. Masais are found here.

Sudan lies in the North of the Equatorial
forests hence there is moderate rainfall
since there is little moisture-bearing winds
and the process of convectional rainfall is
not a major feature here.

In west Africa N-E trade winds blow
from the Sahara Desert & reach Guinea
coast as dry dust-laden winds called
locally ‘Harmattan’ means the doctor
which increases the rate of evaporation &
provides cooling effect at Guinea coast; but
it is such a dry dusty wind that besides
ruining the crops sometimes it may cause
fire; it also stirs up a thick dusty haze &
impedes inland.

For Question 146.---------------
Explanation:

The structure of a Tropical cyclone

The diameter of a cyclone is 600 - 1200
km.

The center of Cyclone is called Eye
which is a small (5km) and calm
region of subsiding air. This sinking
air suppresses cloud formation creating a
pocket of generally clear air in the center.
People experiencing an eye passage at
night often see stars.

The cause of eye formation is still not fully
understood. It probably has to do with

SW

 


the combination of “the conservation of
angular momentum” and centrifugal force.
The conservation of angular momentum
means is objects will spin faster as they
move toward the center of circulation. So
air increases its speed as it heads toward
the center of the tropical cyclone.

Surrounding the Eye is Eyeball a region
of strong spiraling ascent of air up to
the Tropopause. Here wind blow at
250 km per hr. Torrential rain occurs

1 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 147.---------------
Explanation:

Tsunamis

Atsunamiisa series oflong waves generated
by a large and sudden displacement of the
ocean. Large earthquakes below or near
the ocean floor are the most common cause
but landslides volcanic activity certain
types of weather and near-earth objects
(e.g. asteroids comets) can also cause a
tsunami.

Tsunamis are not related to tides so
tsunamis are not tidal waves.

When they reach the coast they can cause
dangerous coastal flooding and powerful
currents that can last for several hours or
days.

A tsunami can strike any ocean coast
at any time. There is no season for
tsunamis. This is quite evident when we
look at some records of past tsunamis. For
instance on March 11 2011 a magnitude
1 earthquake off the east coast of
Japan generated a tsunami that caused
tremendous devastation locally and was


observed throughout the Pacific. The
earthquake was the largest ever recorded
in Japan. The tsunami reached as high as
127 feet (89 meters) and traveled up to five
miles (eight kilometers) inland.

1 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 148.---------------
Explanation:

The factors responsible for variation in
the horizontal distribution of pressure are
as follows:

Air Temperature: The earth is not heated
uniformly because of unequal distribution of
insolation differential heating and cooling
of land and water surfaces. Generally
there is an inverse relationship between
air temperature and air pressure. The
higher the air temperature the lower is
the air pressure. In polar region cold air is
very dense hence it descends and pressure
increases. From this we might expect a
gradual increase in average temperature
towards equator.

The Earth’s Rotation: The earth’s rotation
generates centrifugal force. This results in
the deflection of air from its original place
causing decrease of pressure. It is believed
that the low pressure belts of the sub Polar
Regions and the high pressure belts of the
sub-tropical regions are created as a result
of the earth’s rotation. The earth’s rotation
also causes convergence and divergence of
moving air.

Pressure of Water Vapour: In winter
the continents are relatively cool and
tend to develop high pressure centres; in
summer they stay warmer than the oceans
and tend to be dominated by low pressure
conversely the oceans are associated with
low pressure in winter and high pressure
in summer.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 149.---------------
Explanation:

Planetary Winds

Planetary winds are major component of
the general global circulation of air. These
are known as planetary winds because
of their prevalence in the global scale
throughout the year. Planetary winds occur
due to temperature and pressure variance
throughout the world.

Trade Wind

Winds blowing from the subtropical high
pressure belt or horse latitudes towards
the equatorial low pressure belt of the
ITCZ are the trade winds. In the Northern
Hemisphere the trade winds blow from the
northeast and are known as the Northeast
Trade Winds; in the Southern Hemisphere
the winds blow from the southeast and are
called the Southeast Trade Winds.

e The weather conditions throughout the
tropical zone remain more or less uniform.
This belt is subjected to seasonal variation
due to northward and southward movement
of sun.

e The equator ward part of the trade wind
is humid because they are characterized by
atmospheric instability thus causing heavy
precipitation.

Westerly Wind

e The Westerlies are the prevailing winds
in the middle latitudes between 35° and
65° blowing from the high pressure area
in the sub tropical high pressure belt i.e.
horse latitudes towards the sub polar low
pressure belt.

e The winds are predominantly from the
south-west to north-east in the Northern
Hemisphere and from the north- west to
southeast in the Southern Hemisphere.

e The Westerlies are strongest in the winter
season at times when the pressure is lower
over the poles while they are weakest in
the summer season when pressures are
higher over the poles.

e The Westerlies are particularly strong
especially in the southern hemisphere as
there is less land in the middle latitudes to
obstruct the flow.

1 Correct Option: (a)
For Question 150.---------------
Explanation:

Laurentian Type of Climate

e The Laurentian type of climate is found
only in two regions. One is north-eastern


North America including eastern
Canada north-east U.S.A. (.e. Maritime
Provinces and the New England states)
and Newfoundland. The Cool Temperate
Eastern Margin (Laurentian) Climate is an
intermediate type of climate between the
British and the Siberian type of climate. It
has features of both the maritime and the
continental climates.

e In the southern hemisphere this climatic
type is absent because only a small section
of the southern continents extends south
of the latitude of 40°S. The only possible
location is in eastern Patagonia south
of Bahia Blanca (lat. 39°S.) to Tierra del
Fuego (lat. 54°S.).

e The predominant vegetation of the
Laurentian type of climate is cool
temperate forest. The heavy rainfall the
warm summers and the damp air from fogs
all favour the growth of trees. Generally
speaking the forest tend to be coniferous
north of the 50°N. parallel of latitude.
South of latitude 50°N. the coniferous
forests give way to deciduous forests. Oak.
beech maple and birch are the principal
trees.

1 Correct option: (c)
For Question 151.---------------
Explanation:

Atmospheric Circulations

e Doldrums also called equatorial
calms equatorial regions of light ocean
currents and winds within the _ inter-
tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) a
belt of converging winds and rising
air encircling Earth near the Equator.
The northeast and southeast trade
winds meet there; this meeting causes
air uplift and often produces clusters of
convective thunderstorms. Doldrums lies
at equator i.e. from 5 degrees north to
5 degrees south.

e Tropical easterly jet streams (TEJ) are
major high-velocity winds in the lower
troposphere called low-level jets (LLJs). In
the tropics the most prominent of these are
the Somali Jet and the African Easterly Jet.
The TEJ is a unique and dominant feature
of the northern hemispheric summer over
southern Asia and northern Africa. The
TEJ is found near between 5° and
20°N. These are usually considered as
temporary jet streams.

e However the Subtropical jet streams
(STJ) are permanent in nature. As its
name suggests they are formed in the sub-
tropical areas. STJ is deflected to the right
in the northern hemisphere and to the left
in the southern hemisphere and at about


30° latitude it becomes concentrated as
the subtropical jet streams. During winter
the STJ is nearly continuous in both
hemispheres. The STJ exists all year in
the southern hemisphere. However it is
intermittent in the northern hemisphere
during summer when it migrates north.

Subtropical Jet Streams are always
westerlies and Tropical Jet Streams
are always easterlies. It is due to the
effect of the Coriolis force.

In the middle latitudes the circulation is
that of sinking cold air that comes from the
poles and the rising warm air that blows
from the subtropical high. At the surface
these winds are called westerlies and the
cell is known as the Ferrel cell. However
Ferrel cell does not derive its strength
from the walker cell. Walker cell is
associated with the El-Nino event that
takes place in the central Pacific Ocean
where warm waters slowly move towards
South America.

A large part of the energy that drives
the Ferrel cell is provided by the polar
and Hadley cells circulating on either
side or that drag the Ferrel cell with

it.

2 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 152.---------------
Explanation:

Thunderstorms and Tornadoes

Thunderstorms and tornadoes are severe
local storms.

They are of short duration occurring
over a small area but are violent.

Thunderstorms are caused by intense
convection on moist hot days.

A thunderstorm is a_ well-grown
cumulonimbus cloud producing thunder
and lightning.

When the clouds extend to heights where
sub-zero temperature prevails hails are
formed and they come down as hailstorm.

If there is insufficient moisture a
thunderstorm can _ generate dust
storms.

A thunderstorm is characterized by the
intense updraft of rising warm air which
causes the clouds to grow bigger and rise toa
greater height. This causes precipitation.

Later downdraft brings down to earth the
cool air and the rain.

From severe thunderstorms sometimes
spiraling wind descends like a trunk of an


elephant with great force with very low
pressure at the center causing massive
destruction on its way. Such a phenomenon
is called a tornado.

Tornadoes generally occur in middle

latitudes.

The tornado over the sea is called
water sprouts.

These violent storms are the manifestation
of the atmosphere’s adjustments to varying
energy distribution.

The potential and heat energies are
converted into kinetic energy in these
storms and the restless atmosphere again
returns to its stable state.

2 Correct option: (a)

Explanation

The system is in force today in three North-
eastern states:

Arunachal Pradesh
Nagaland

Mizoram

Supplementary notes

Inner Line Permit (ILP)

The Inner Line Permit concept comes
from the colonial area. Under the Bengal
Eastern Frontier Regulation Act 1873 the
British framed regulations restricting the
entry and regulating the stay of outsiders
in designated areas.

Inner Line Permit (ILP) is an official travel
document issued by the Government of
India to allow inward travel of an Indian
citizen into a protected area for a limited
period.

It is obligatory for Indian citizens from
outside those states to obtain a permit for
entering into the protected state.

The documentisan effort by the government
to regulate movement to certain areas
located near the international border of
India.

There are different kinds of ILP’s one for
tourists and others for people who intend
to stay for long-term periods often for
employment purposes.

Where is it applicable?

The system is in force today in three North-
eastern states:

>» Arunachal Pradesh
>» Nagaland
>» Mizoram

No Indian citizen can visit any of these
states unless he or she does not belong
to that state nor can he or she overstay
beyond the period specified in the ILP.

Relation between ILP and Citizenship
Amendment Bill

The Citizenship Amendment Bill seeks
to amend the existing Citizenship Act
1955 to enable non-Muslim refugees
- specifically Hindus Jains Sikhs
Buddhists Parsis and Christians — from
Pakistan Bangladesh and Afghanistan to
obtain Indian citizenship.

If the bill is passed and implemented with
the ILP system also in place it would mean
the refugees who are granted citizenship
under the new act will not be permitted
to settle in Arunachal Pradesh Nagaland
and Mizoram.

Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland are
not among those drastically affected by
migration from Bangladesh.

Mizoram shares a border with Bangladesh.

The three states that have seen the highest
migration however are Assam Tripura
and Meghalaya none of which has an ILP
system.

per cent of the state’s population. They
have controlled large parts of Assam in the
past.

Bi Bodoland Territorial
Autonomous Districts

Map not to scale


The four districts in Assam — Kokrajhar
Baksa Udalguri and Chirang — that
constitute the Bodo Territorial Area
District (BTAD) are home to several ethnic
groups.

The Bodos have had a long history of
separatist demands marked by armed
struggle.

In 1966-67 the demand for a separate
state called Bodoland was raised under

the banner of the Plains Tribals Council of
Assam (PTCA) a political outfit.

In 1987 the All Bodo Students Union
(ABSU) renewed the demand. “Divide
Assam fifty-fifty” was a call given by
the ABSU’s then leader Upendra Nath
Brahma.

The unrest was a fallout of the Assam
Movement (1979-85) whose culmination
— the Assam Accord — addressed the
demands of protection and safeguards for
the “Assamese people” leading the Bodos
to launch a movement to protect their own
identity.

In December 2014 separatists killed more
than 30 people in Kokrajhar and Sonitpur.
In the 2012 Bodo-Muslim riots hundreds
were killed and almost 5 lakh were
displaced.

The Home Ministry has declared the NDFB
along with all its groups factions and front
organisations as an “unlawful association”
under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention)
Act 196

Who are the NDFB?

Alongside political movements armed
groups have also sought to create a separate
Bodo state.

In October 1986 the prominent group
Bodo Security Force (BdSF) was formed by
Ranjan Daimary. The BdSF subsequently
renamed itself as the National Democratic
Front of Bodoland (NDFB) an organisation
that is known to be involved in attacks
killings and extortions.

In the 1990s Indian security forces
launched extensive operations against
the group causing the latter to flee to
bordering Bhutan. In Bhutan the group
faced stiff counter-insurgency operations
by the Indian Army and the Royal Bhutan
Army in the early 2000s.

NDFB factions and their activities

In October 2008 bomb attacks in Assam
carried out by the NDFB killed 90 people. In
January this year 10 operatives including


founder Ranjan Daimary were convicted
for their role in the attacks.

After the blasts the NDFB was divided
into two factions — the NDFB () led by
Gobinda Basumatary and the NDFB (R)
led by Ranjan Daimary.

The NDFB (P) started talks with the central
government in 200 In 2010 Daimary
was arrested and handed over to India by
Bangladesh and was granted bail in 201
His faction too then began peace talks with
the government.

In 2012 Ingti Kathar Songbijit broke
away from the NDFB (R) and formed his
own faction the NDFB (S). His faction
is believed to be behind the killing of 66
Adivasis in Assam in December 201 The
NDFB (8) is against holding talks.

In 2015 Songbijit was removed as the chief
of the group and B Saoraigwra took over.
This faction of the NDFB is still active
while Songbijit himself a Karbi and not
a Bodo is said to have started his own
militant group.

Why the demand for separate Bodoland?

For centuries they survived sanskritisation
without giving up their original ethnic
identity. However in the 20th century
they had to tackle a series of issues such
as illegal immigration encroachment of
their lands forced assimilation loss of
language and culture. The 20th century
also witnessed the emergence of Bodos as
a leading tribe in Assam which pioneered
the movements for safeguarding the rights
of the tribal communities in the area.

From then on they have been consistently
deprived of the political and socio-economic
rights by successive state and central
governments. The Bodos have not only
become an ethnic minority in their own
ancestral land but have also been struggling
for their existence and status as an ethnic
community.

2 Correct Answer (b)

For Question 154.---------------
Explanation:

4 statement is incorrect: the union
territories of Dadra and Nagar Havelli and
Daman and Diu speak different language
and diverse ethnicity.

Supplementary Notes

Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar
Haveli

These two UTs are located in the western
region of India.


Daman and Diu are two _ widely
separated districts situated on
the southern side of Gujarat. Daman is
an enclave on Gujarat’s southern coast and
Diu encompasses an island off the southern
coast of Gujarat’s Kathiawar Peninsula. It
is in close proximity of the UT of DNH.

Dadra and Nagar Haveli consists of two
separate parts. Dadra is surrounded by the
state of Gujarat and Nagar Haveli lies on
the borders of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Both were colonised by the Portuguese and
were liberated in December 196

In 1987 when Goa got statehood Daman
and Diu were made a separate Union
Territory from the previous Union Territory
of Goa Daman and Diu.

Recently a bill for the merger of Union
Territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli
and Daman and Diu was introduced in the
Parliament by Home Minister.

The Bill provides for the merger of the
Union Territories (UTs) of Dadra and
Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu into a
single UT.

Key features of the Bill include:

>» Amendment of the
Constitution: The First Schedule
to the Constitution specifies the
territories that come under various
states and UTs. The Bill amends the
First Schedule to merge the territories
of the two UTs: (a) Dadra and Nagar
Haveli and (b) Daman and Diu. The
merged territory will form the UT of
Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman
and Diu. This will come into effect
from the day notified by the central
government.

Article 240(1) of the Constitution allows
the President to make regulations for
certain UTs including the UTs of Dadra
and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.
The Bill amends the Article to replace
these two UTs with the merged UT.

Representation in Lok Sabha: The
First Schedule to the Representation of
the People Act 1950 provides one seat in
Lok Sabha to each of the two UTs. The Bill
seeks to amend the Schedule to allocate
two Lok Sabha seats to the merged UT.

Services under the UTs: Every person
employed in connection with the affairs of
the existing UTs will provisionally serve
the merged UT. The central government
will determine whether every such person
will finally be allotted for service in the
merged UT.
The merged UT will take steps to integrate
employees into services under its control.
The central government may give orders
and instructions to the merged UT in this
regard.

The central government may establish
Advisory Committees to assist in ensuring
fair treatment of all persons affected
by these provisions and consideration
of any representations made by them.
Representations against any service orders
must be made within three months from
the date of publication or notice of the
order whichever is earlier.

Jurisdiction of High Court: The Bill
provides that the jurisdiction of the High
Court of Bombay will continue to extend to
the merged UT.

Reasons for Merging Two UTs

Both UTs have two separate constitutional
and administrative bodies which lead to a
lot of duplicacy inefficiency and wasteful
expenditure.

The merger will help in achieving the
government’s goal to have Minimum
Government Maximum Governance.


Both of them have small population and
limited geographical area so the merger
will not be challenging and the services of
officers will be used efficiently.

Option (a) is correct.

Supplementary Notes

The day is observed annually to highlight
the importance of healthy soil and advocate
for the sustainable management of soil
resources. The theme for WSD 2019 was
‘Stop Soil Erosion Save Our Future’.

Historical background:

In 2002 the International Union of
Soil Science (USS) voted for a resolution
to dedicate 5th December every year as
World Soil Day to promote the importance
of Nature and human wellbeing.

Food and Agriculture organization
(FAO) supported this initiative
together with the Kingdom of
Thailand leadership as a part of “Global
soil partnership”.

FAO took the initiative to establish Soil
Day. Consequently unanimously approved
it in its FAO conference 201

Later in 2013 December with FAO’s
request UN adopted World Soil Day in
its 68th UN General Assembly. Further
announced that the day would be observed
on 5th December every year.

Especially this is a tribute to late King
Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand for
his contribution in improving quality and
sustainable management of soil.

Thereby FAO has been celebrating world
soil day since 201

Highlights about the World Soil Day:

Annually to celebrate the day World Soil
Day award is distributed to honour the
contributions made by people. That is
FAO gives two awards in line with this
day-

» The King Bhumibol World Soil
Day Award- an annual award that
honours individuals communities
organizations and countries that
organized remarkable and engaging
World Soil Day activities or campaigns
in the previous year.

>» The Glinka World Soil Prize- An
annual award for dynamic change-


makers dedicated to solving one of our

world’s most pressing environmental

issue: soil degradation. It honours
individuals and organizations whose
leadership and _ activities have e
contributed or are still contributing

to the promotion of sustainable soil
management and the protection of soil

resources.

The trade diversion effects of the US-
China tariff war for the first half of
2019 at about $21 billion implying
that the amount of net trade losses

For Question 157.---------------
Explanation:
Abyssal Plain

Abyssal Plain is an underwater plain on
the deep ocean floor.

It lies between the foot of a continental
rise and a mid-ocean ridge.

Abyssal plains cover more than 50% of the
Earth’s surface and two-thirds of the ocean
floor.

It was once thought to be featureless but
modern sounding devices reveal that the
abyssal plain is far from being level. It
has an extensive submarine plateau
ridges trenches basins and oceanic
islands that rise above sea level in
the midst of oceans e.g. the Azores
Ascension Islands.

Creation of the abyssal plain

The creation of the abyssal plain is the
result of the spreading of the seafloor
on both sides of a divergent boundary and
the melting of the lower oceanic crust.

Magma after rising from the asthenosphere
and upon reaching the surface at mid-
ocean ridges it forms a new oceanic crust
and thereby the Abyssal Plain.

Owing in part to their vast size abyssal

For Question 162.---------------
Explanation:

Storm surge


Storm surge is the abnormal rise in
sea level generated by a hurricane or
other intense storm over and above
the predicted or normal astronomical
tide. It is caused mainly by atmospheric
weather systems such as tropical cyclones
hurricane winds shoving the ocean water
up over the coast although low pressure
in the eye also contributes a much smaller
amount.

In general one may expect that if there is
a storm surge of x meters and tidal wave of
y meters then during high tide total surges
would be xty and during low tide x-y. But
it is found that there is an interaction of
storm surge with astronomical tide and
during high tide time the total surge is
little less than x+y and during low tide
time it is little more than x-y.

Disaster potential due to cyclones is due
to high storm surges occurring at the
time of landfall. The storm surges are
by far the greatest killers in a cyclone as
seawater inundates low lying areas of
the coastal regions causing heavy floods
erosion of beaches and embankments
damage to vegetation and reducing soil
fertility. Flooding due to storm surges
pollute drinking water sources resulting in
a shortage of drinking water and causing
out-break of epidemics mostly water-
borne diseases Very strong winds (Gales)
may cause uprooting of trees damage
to dwellings overhead installations
communication lines etc. resulting in loss
of life and property.

agents of weathering and carried to sea
by the agents of erosion such as running
water wind etc.

The correct sequence of terrigenous deposits
from the coast to the deeper part of the sea
is Sand-Silt-Clay-Mud.

In volcanic regions the deposits of
continental shelf and slope consist chiefly
of products of voleanism which are subject
to chemical and mechanical weathering
and are carried to the ocean by actions of
running water and wind.

For Question 165.---------------
Explanation:

Pelagic Deposits

Pelagic deposits are the most conspicuous
of all deposits covering about 75% of the
total seafloor. The pelagic deposits consist
of both organic and inorganic material.

Organic Material

This is in the form of a kind of liquid mud
called ooze which contains shells and
skeletons of various marine organisms.
The ooze is said to be calcareous when
the shell is made of calcium carbonate.
Most parts of the Indian and Atlantic
Oceans have calcareous ooze as deposits.
When the shell is made of silica the ooze
is said to be siliceous ooze which can be
either the diatom type or the radiolarian
type of ooze. The southern fringes of the
Indian and the Atlantic Oceans have the
siliceous type of ooze.

Inorganic Material

This is in the form of red clay which is
apparently of a volcanic origin. The chief
constituents of red clay are silicon and
aluminum dioxide while other constituents
include iron manganese phosphorus and


radium. The red clay is the most widely
spread pelagic deposit and covers 38%
of the seafloor. The red clay covers more
than half of the Pacific floor.

For Question 167.---------------
Explanation:

Oceanic circulation

Oceanic circulations are categorized as
waves tides and currents.

Waves are formed due to friction between
wind and surface water layer. The stronger
the wind the bigger the wave. They die out
quickly on reaching the shore or shallow
waters.

Tides are formed due to Gravity of
the Moon and the Sun and the Earth’s
rotation.

The primary forces that cause the ocean
currents are wind Insolation Gravity
and rotation of the Earth.

The secondary forces that influence the
currents are friction (by the oceanic reliefs
and Continents) Temperature difference
and Salinity difference.

There are three major types of ocean gyres:
tropical subtropical and subpolar.

The Northern Hemisphere has several
subpolar gyres bounded by islands such as
Iceland Greenland and the Aleutians; and
the northern reaches of Scandinavia Asia
and North America.

Tropical gyres form near the Equator. The
Coriolis effect is not present at the Equator
and winds are the primary creators of
currents. For this reason tropical gyres
tend to flow in a more east-west (instead of
circular) pattern. The Indian Ocean Gyre
is actually two distinct tropical gyres—
the northern and southern Indian Ocean
Gyres.

Most of the world’s major gyres are
subtropical gyres. These form between
the polar and equatorial regions of Earth.
Subtropical gyres circle areas beneath
regions of high atmospheric pressure.

There are five major gyres formed by the
systems of ocean currents.

These are (i) North Pacific Subtropical
Gyre (Turtle Gyre) (ii) South Pacific
Subtropical Gyre (Heyerdahl Gyre)
(iii) North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre
(Columbus Gyre) (iv) South Atlantic
Subtropical Gyre (Prince Henry Gyre)
and (v) Indian Ocean Subtropical Gyre
(Majid Gyre).

For Question 168.---------------
Explanation:

Ocean Currents

The currents in the northern portion of the
Indian Ocean change their direction from
season to season in response to the seasonal
rhythm of the monsoons. The effect of
winds is comparatively more pronounced
in the Indian Ocean.

The south equatorial current in the Indian
Ocean splits into two branches viz. one
flowing to the east of Madagascar known
as Agulhas current and the other between
Mozambique and Western Madagascar
coast known as Mozambique current. Both
are warm currents.

The Antilles Current is a highly variable
surface ocean current of warm water that
flows northeasterly past the island chain
that separates the Caribbean Sea and the
Atlantic Ocean. The current results from
the flow of the Atlantic North Equatorial
Current.

The Labrador Current flows along part
of the east coast of Canada and meets the
warm Gulf Stream. The confluence of
these two currents one hot and the other
cold produce the famous fogs around the at
the Grand Banks of Newfoundland in
Canada. As a result of the mixing of cold
and warm waters here the world’s most
important fishing grounds is created.

Explanation:

Salinity distribution

The horizontal salinity distribution of
the water bodies depends on evaporation
freezing melting freshwater influx
precipitation geographical location etc.

Dead sea is one of the most saline
water bodies of the world due to
high evaporation and land locking.
Mediterranean sea is also very salty
due to land locking. But it is less salty
than the Dead Sea.

Arabian Sea is saltier than the Bay of
Bengal due to less river water influx.
And both these water bodies are less
salty than the Mediterranean sea due
to high precipitation and openness.
The Don Juan Pond in Antarctica
is the most saline water body on the
earth.

1 Correct Option (c)

For Question 170.---------------
Explanation:
Tides

The periodical rise and fall of the sea
level once or twice a day mainly due to
the attraction of the sun and the moon is
called a tide.

The Moon’s gravitational pull to a great
extent and to a lesser extent the Sun’s
gravitational pull are the major causes for
the occurrence of tides. Another factor is
centrifugal force which acts opposite to the
gravitational pull of Earth.

Based on the Sun Moon and the Earth
Positions they are of two types viz. Spring
tides and Neap tides.

When the sun the moon and the earth
are in a straight line the height of the
tide is higher and called spring tides and
they occur twice a month one on full moon
period and another during the new moon
period.

When the sun and moon are at right
angles to each other then the forces of
the sun and moon tend to counteract
one another. It is called the neap tide.

The time between the high tide and
low tide when the water level is
falling is called the ebb whereas the
time between the low tide and high
tide when the tide is rising is called
the flood.

When a tide enters the narrow and
shallow gulf or an estuary of a river
the front of the tidal wave appears
to be vertical owing to the piling up
of water of the river against the tidal
wave and the friction of the river
bed. The steep-nosed tide crest looks
like a vertical wall of-water rushing
upstream and is known as a tidal
bore.

1 Correct option: (b)

For Question 171.---------------
Explanation:

Isotherms

Isotherm is an imaginary line joining places
having equal temperatures. Isotherms
have a close correspondence with the
latitude parallels mainly because the same
amount of insolation is received by all the
points located on the same latitude.


The isotherms are irregular over
the northern hemisphere due to an
enhanced land-sea contrast. Because of
the predominance of land over water in the
north the Northern hemisphere is warmer.
The thermal equator (ITCZ) lies generally
to the north of the geographical equator.
Isotherms are more regular and follow
latitudes in the southern hemisphere.

Wind direction largely affects the
distribution of temperature of ocean
water. The winds blowing from the land
towards the oceans and seas (e.g. offshore
winds) drive warm surface water away
from the coast resulting in the upwelling
of cold bottom water from below. Thus the
replacement of warm water by cold water
introduces a longitudinal variation in
temperature. Contrary to this the onshore
winds pile up warm water near the coast
and thus raise the temperature.

The enclosed seas (Marginal Seas -
Gulf Bay etc.) in the low latitudes
record relatively higher temperatures
than the open seas; whereas the
enclosed seas in the high latitudes
have a lower temperature than the
open seas.

1 Correct option: (c)

For Question 172.---------------
Explanation:

Ground Water Resource

Groundwater is the water that seeps
through rocks and soil and is stored
below the ground. The rocks in which
groundwater is stored are called
aquifers. Aquifers are typically made
up of gravel sand sandstone or
limestone. Water moves through these
rocks because they have large connected
spaces that make them permeable.

The overall contribution of rainfall to the
country’s annual groundwater resource
is 68% and the share of other resources
such as canal seepage return flow from
irrigation recharge from tanks ponds
and water conservation structures taken
together is 32%. Thus good rainfall
translates into good groundwater
storage.

An underground layer of water-
bearing permeable rock or gravel/
sand or silt from which groundwater
can be extracted using a water well is
called an aquifer. Trapped between the
impermeable layers water towards the
bottom of the aquifer is under tremendous
pressure because of weight on top. When a
well pierces the impermeable layer above

cEJSCORE

the aquifer the pressure is released and
water gushes up. If the pressure is great
enough water may spurt into the air in a
spectacular fountain.

Deccan lava has porous and semi-permeable
rocks where land is typically underlain
by hard-rock formations. These rocks
give rise to a complex and extensive low-
storage aquifer system wherein the water
level tends to drop very rapidly once the
water table falls by more than 2-6 meters.
Additionally these aquifers have poor
permeability which limits their recharge
through rainfall. This implies that water
in these aquifers is non-replenishable
and will eventually dry out due to
continuous usage making Deccan trap
groundwater poor region.

1 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 173.---------------
Explanation:

Major Division of Ocean Hour

Four major divisions can easily be identified
on the ocean floor-

>» The Continental Shelf
>» The Continental Slope
» The Continental Rise
>» The Abyssal Plain.

Besides these there are many associated
features-ridges hills seamounts guyots
trenches canyons sleeps fracture zones
island arcs atolls coral reefs submerged
volcanoes and sea-scarps.

This great variety of relief is largely due to
interaction of tectonic volcanic erosional
and depositional processes.

At greater depths the tectonic and volcanic
phenomena are more significant processes.

Continental Shelf

This is a gentle seaward sloping surface
extending from the coasts towards the open
sea. In all about 5% of the total area of
the oceans is covered by the continental
shelves. The shelfis formed by the drowning
of a part of a continent with a relative rise
in sea level or marine deposition beneath
the water.

The average width of the continental
shelf is about 70 km and mean slope is
less than one degree but the width shows
great variety from location to location. For
instance it is almost absent in the eastern
Pacific especially of South America and is
upto 120 km wide along the eastern coast
of USA. The seaward edge of the shelf is
usually 150-200 metres deep.


The continental shelves are mostly covered
by sediments of terrestrial origin. There
are various types of shelves-glaciated shelf
coral reef shelf and shelf of a large river
shelf with dendritic valleys and the shelf
along young mountain ranges.

Continental Slope

Marking the seaward edge of the continental
shelf is the Continental Slope. This slope
is steeper than the shelf and it marks the
boundary between continental crust and
oceanic crust. Although the steepness of
the continental slope varies greatly from
place to place it averages about 5 degrees.
In some places the slope may exceed
25 degrees. The continental slope is a
relatively narrow feature averaging only
about 20 kilometers in width.

Deep steep-sided valleys known as
submarine canyons are cut into the
continental slope. These canyons may
extend to the ocean basin floor. Submarine
canyons have been eroded at least in part
by turbidity currents.

Turbidity currents are occasional
movements of dense sediment-rich water
down the continental slope.

They are created when sand and mud
on the continental shelf and slope are
disturbed-perhaps by an earthquake-and
become suspended in the water. Because
such muddy water is denser than normal
seawater it flows down the slope. As it
flows down it erodes and accumulates
more sediment. Erosion from these muddy
torrents is believed to be the major force in
the formation of most submarine canyons.
Narrow continental margins such as the
one located along the California coast
are marked with numerous submarine
canyons.

Turbidity currents are known to be
an important mechanism of sediment
transport in the ocean. Turbidity currents
erode submarine canyons and deposit
sediments on the deep-ocean floor.

Continental Rise

Continental rise a major depositional
regime in oceans made up of thick sequences
of continental material that accumulate
between the continental slope and the
abyssal plain. Continental Rises form as
a result of three sedimentary processes:
mass wasting the deposition from contour
currents and the vertical settling of clastic
and biogenic particles.
The continental slope gradually loses its
steepness with depth. When the slope
reaches a level of between 5° and 1° it
is referred to as the continental rise. With
increasing depth the rise becomes virtually
flat and merges with the abyssal plain.

Abyssal Plains

Beyond the continental rise at depths
from 3000 m to 6000 m lie the deep sea
plains called abyssal plains or abyssal
floors. Covering nearly 40% of the ocean
floor the abyssal plains are present in all
major oceans and several seas of the world.
They are uniquely fl at with a gradient
of less than 1000 The large supply of
terrigenous and shallow water sediments
buries the irregular topography to form a
generally flat relief.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 174.---------------
Explanation:

Reasons for the Varying Salinity of the Sea
Water

Evaporation and Precipitation

Evaporation causes concentration of salt.
Highest salinity is found near the tropics
because of active evaporation owing to
clear sky high temperature and steady
trade winds. Salinity decreases towards
the equator because of heavier rainfall. In
the Atlantic Ocean the salinity near the
tropics is 37% and near the equator it is
only 35%.

Stream run off

The areas which receive fresh water by
rivers have low salinity e.g. huge amount
of fresh water brought by the Danube the
Dnieper and the Don into the Black Sea
reduces its salinity to 17%.

Freezing and Melting of Ice

In the polar areas there is very little
evaporation and this coupled with the
melting of ice yielding fresh water leads
to a decrease in salinity usually between
20% and 32%.

Atmospheric Pressure and Wind Direction

Salinity changes slightly due to winds
resulting from differences in atmospheric
pressure. Of the Californian coast North
East Trade winds carry the warm saline
water far offthe coast and consequently
colder and less saline water start upwelling
from below.


Ocean Currents

The currents stirred by wind sweep away
saline water from the eastern coast of
the high latitudes to the western coasts
whereas cold water penetrates into the
low latitudes. Thus there is a tendency
for salinity to increase from east to west.
Salinity is higher in enclosed seas as
compared to open seas. The salinity of the
Red Sea is 40% and that of the Dead Sea
is 28%. This is because of high rate of
evaporation lack of supply of fresh water
in enclosed seas.

The Baltic Sea receives many fresh water
rivers from the neighboring shield areas
and with a low rate of evaporation the
salinity is only 2% at the head of the Gulf
of Bothnia. The Mediterranean waters
do not mix freely with the open ocean. In
the hot dry summers there is very rapid
evaporation. The Nile is the only large
river entering the eastern parts and brings
down much salt so that the salinity of the
eastern Mediterranean in summer is about
40%. Further east in the inland Dead Sea
the salinity is almost 240% and there is
salt accumulation along the shores.

The movement of ocean waters takes
place in three different forms viz. waves
currents and tides. Ocean water moves
horizontally as well as vertically.

These movements are due to variation in
density from one part to another which
results from the differences in salinity and
temperatures. Winds also provide a motive
force for the horizontal movement of surface
water. The movement of surface water in
which the rise and fall of water surface is
more predominant than the actual forward
motion of the water particles is called waves.
When the movement of a mass of water ina
fairly definite direction over great distances
takes place is called current. Currents are
caused by the differences in salinity drag
of winds shape and position of coasts and
variation in temperature.

Currents are of two types: Warm currents
and Cold currents. Currents exert an
influence on the climate of the bordering
coastal regions. They provide plankton a
food for the fish. Important ocean routes
follow the favorable currents. There are
important currents in Pacific Ocean the
Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.

1 Correct Option: (d)
For Question 175.---------------
Explanation:

Types of Tides

Tides vary in their frequency direction
and movement from place to place and also

100


from time to time. Tides may be grouped
into various types based on their frequency
of occurrence in one day or 24 hours or
based on their height.

Tides based on Frequency

Semi-diurnal tide: The most common
tidal pattern featuring two high tides and
two low tides each day. The successive
high or low tides are approximately of the
same height.

Diurnal tide: There is only one high
tide and one low tide during each day.
The successive high and low tides are
approximately of the same height.

Mixed tide: Tides having variations in
height are known as mixed tides. These
tides generally occur along the west coast
of North America and on many islands of
the Pacific Ocean.

Tides based on the Sun Moon and the
Earth Positions:

The height of rising water (high tide) varies
appreciably depending upon the position of
sun and moon with respect to the earth.
Spring tides and neap tides come under
this category.

Spring tides: The position of both the sun
and the moon in relation to the earth has
direct bearing on tide height. When the sun
the moon and the earth are in a straight
line the height of the tide will be higher.
These are called spring tides and they occur
twice a month one on full moon period and
another during new moon period.

Neap tides: Normally there is a seven day
interval between the spring tides and neap
tides. At this time the sun and moon are at
right angles to each other and the forces of
the sun and moon tend to counteract one
another. The Moon’s attraction though
more than twice as strong as the sun’s
is diminished by the counteracting force
of the sun’s gravitational pull. Once in a
month when the moon’s orbit is closest
to the earth (perigee) unusually high and
low tides occur. During this time the tidal
range is greater than normal. Two weeks
later when the moon is farthest from earth
(apogee) the moon’s gravitational force is
limited and the tidal ranges are less than
their average heights. When the earth is
closest to the sun (perihelion) around 3rd
January each year tidal ranges are also
much greater with unusually high and
unusually low tides. When the earth is
farthest from the sun (aphelion) around
Ath July each year tidal ranges are much
less than average. The time between the


high tide and low tide when the water
level is falling is called the ebb. The time
between the low tide and high tide when
the tide is rising is called the flow or flood.

2 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 176.---------------
Explanation:

The Circulation of the Atlantic Ocean

The steady Trade Winds constantly drift
two streams of water from east to west.
At the ‘shoulder’ of north-east Brazil the
protruding land mass splits the South
Equatorial Current into the Cayenne
Current which flows along the Guiana
coast and the Brazilian Current which
flows southwards along the east coast of
Brazil.

In the North Atlantic Ocean the Cayenne
Current is joined and reinforced by the
North Equatorial Current and heads north-
westwards as a large mass of equatorial
water into the Caribbean Sea. Part of the
current enters the Gulf of Mexico and
emerges from the Florida Strait between
Florida and Cuba as the Florida Current.
The rest of the equatorial water flows
northwards east of the Antilles to join
the Gulf Stream off the south-eastern
U.S.A. The Gulf Stream Drift is one of the
strongest ocean currents 35 to 100 miles
wide 2000 feet deep and with a velocity of
three miles an hour. The current hugs the
coast of America as far as Cape Hatteras
(latitude 35°N.) where it is deflected
eastwards under the combined influence
of the Westerlies and the rotation of the
earth. It reaches Europe as the North
Atlantic Drift. This current flowing at 10
miles per day carries the warm equatorial
water for over a thousand miles to the
coasts of Europe. From the North Atlantic
it fans out in three directions eastwards
to Britain northwards to the Arctic and
southwards along the Iberian coast as
the cool Canaries Current. Oceanographic
researches show that almost two- thirds of
the water brought by the Gulf Stream to
the Arctic regions is returned annually to
the tropical latitudes by dense cold polar
water that creeps southwards in the ocean
depths. The Canaries Current flowing
southwards eventually merges with the
North Equatorial Current completing
the clockwise circuit in the North Atlantic
Ocean. Within this ring of currents an
area in the middle of the Atlantic has no
perceptible current. A large amount of
floating sea-weed gathers and the area is
called the Sargasso Sea.
Apart from the clockwise circulation of the
currents there are also currents that enter
the North Atlantic from the Arctic regions.
These cold waters are blown south by the
out-flowing polar winds. The Irminger
Current or East Greenland Current
flows between Iceland and Greenland
and cools the North Atlantic Drift at
the point of convergence. The cold
Labrador Current drifts south-eastwards
between West Greenland and Baffin
Island to meet the warm Gulf Stream off
Newfoundland as far south as 50°N. where
the icebergs carried south by the Labrador
Current melt.

The South Atlantic Ocean follows the same
pattern of circulation as the North Atlantic
Ocean. The major differences are that the
circuit is anti-clockwise and the collection
of sea-weed in the still waters of the mid-
South Atlantic is not so distinctive.

Where the South Equatorial Current is
split at Cape Sao Roque one branch
turns south as the warm Brazilian
Current. Its deep blue waters are easily
distinguishable from the yellow muddy
waters carried hundreds of miles out to
sea by the Amazon further north. At about
40°S.

The influence of the prevailing Westerlies
and the rotation of the earth propel the
current eastwards to merge with the cold
West Wind Drift as the South Atlantic
Current. On reaching the west coast of
Africa the current is diverted northwards
as the cold Benguela Current (the
counterpart of the Canaries Current).

It brings the cold polar waters of the West
Wind Drift into tropical latitudes. Driven
by the regular South-East Trade Winds the
Benguela Current surges equatorwards in
a north-westerly direction to join the South
Equatorial Current.

This completes the circulation of the
currents in the South Atlantic. Between
the North and South Equatorial Currents
is the east- flowing Equatorial Counter
Current.

For Question 177.---------------
Explanation:

The Oceanic Deposits of the Ocean Floor

Materials eroded from the earth which are
not deposited by rivers or at the coast are
eventually dropped on the ocean floor. The
dominant process is slow sedimentation
where the eroded particles very slowly filter
through the ocean water and settle upon


one another in layers. The thickness of
the layer of sediments is still unknown. Its
rate of accumulation is equally uncertain.
Generally speaking we may classify all the
oceanic deposits as either muds oozes or
clays.

>» The muds-These are terrigenous
deposits because they are derived
from land and are mainly deposited
on the continental shelves. The muds
are referred to as blue green or red
muds; their colouring depends upon
their chemical content.

>» The oozes-These are pelagic deposits
because they are derived from the
oceans. They are made of the shelly
and skeletal remains of marine
microorganisms with calcareous or
siliceous parts. Oozes have a very fine;
flour-like texture and either occur as
accumulated deposits or float about in
suspension.

>» The clays-These occur mainly as red
clays in the deeper parts of the ocean
basins and arc particularly abundant
in the Pacific Ocean. Red clay is
believed to be an accumulation of
volcanic dust blown out from volcanoes
during volcanic eruptions.

Importance of the Himalayas

Himalayas forms the natural and political
boundaries of India. Due to the location of
Himalayas the Indian subcontinent has
been able to have its own identity apart
from the Asian mainland

It plays an important role in the
determination of the climate of India.

It stand like a mighty wall and protect
India from foreign invasion.

It obstructs the way of the cold polar winds
as a result the Indian sub-continent is
saved from the Polar waves.

Similarly Himalayas act as a barrier for
the moisture-laden south-western monsoon
winds.

Himalayas make the rivers perennial
by continuous supply of the water by the
melting of snow. These perennial rivers
make the development of irrigation and
hydroelectricity facilities possible.

Himalayas region contains a rich
amount of mineral resources. Cobalt
Nickel Zinc Copper Antimony Bismuth
etc. are the metallic minerals. Non-metallic
minerals like Coal and Petroleum are
also found here. Coal in the Himalayas is

 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 187.---------------
Explanation:

Himalayas

Regarding the evolution of Himalayas
the Geosynclinal Theory of Kober and
the Plate-Tectonics Theory of Harry
Hess are considered most acceptable.

According to Kober about 70 million
years ago there was a geo-syncline called
Tethys Sea in the place of the Himalayas
and it separated the Angaraland in the
north and Gondwanaland in the south.
The sediments from these two headlands
were deposited into the Tethys Sea. These
sediments gradually got raised due to the
compression forces of the two landmasses.
This compression of the sediments formed
the fold mountain ranges of Kunlun
Himalaya and Karakoram. The median
mass(middle portion of geo syncline) less
affected by the folding is known as the
Tibetan Plateau.

According to the Plate-Tectonic theory
about 70 million years ago the Indian plate
in the south moved in the northeastern
direction towards the Eurasian plate.
About 20-30 million years ago these two
land-masses got very close due to which the
sediments in the Tethys Sea got folded and
Himalayas were evolved. Approx 10 million
years ago all the ranges of Himalayas got
fully developed.

are the main ranges. Nanga Parbat (8126
m) is an important range which is in The
Zaskar Range.

The Great Himalaya is also known as Inner
Himalaya Central Himalaya or Himadri.
This mountain range boasts of the tallest
peaks of the world most of which remain
under perpetual snow. The total west to
east extension of the great Himalayas is
2400 km and terminates abruptly at the
syntaxial bends.

Middle or the Lesser Himalaya is between
the Shiwaliks in the south and the
Greater Himalayas in the north. It is also

called the Himachal or Lower Himalaya.
Middle Himalayas are known by the
Mussoorie and the Nag Tibba ranges
in Uttarakhand and Dhauladhar in
Himachal Pradesh. East of the Kosi
River the Sapt Kosi Sikkim Bhutan Miri
Abor and Mishmi hills represent the lower
Himalayas.

Shiwalik/ Outer Himalayas is located
between the Great Plains and Lesser
Himalayas. Its altitude varies from 600
to 1500 meters. It runs for a distance
of 2400 km from the Potwar Plateau
(Pakistan) to the Brahmaputra valley.
The width of the Shiwaliks varies from
50 km in Himachal Pradesh to less
than 15 km in Arunachal Pradesh. The
Shiwaliks are consolidated sands gravels

For Question 189.---------------
Explanation:

Kashmir valley

Kashmir Valley is surrounded by Great
Himalayan Range in the northeast and the
Pir Panjal Range in the southwest. The
basin is formed by tectonic upliftment
of Pir Panjal Range which impound the
drainage of Himalayan side and gave rise
to a vast lake known as “Karewa Lake”.

Tectonically Kashmir Valley constitutes
the Nappe Zone representing a tectonic
depression formed by the upliftment of Pir
Panjal Range along the Panjal thrust. The
Valley in the form of a graben is flanked
by two horsts Pir Panjal Range in the
southwestern side and Zanskar Range in
the northeastern side.

The word “Karewa” is derived from
Kashmiri dialect meaning “Wudars”. The
lake was drained through the Baramullah
“Tatamulla Gorge” due to continued
upliftment of Pir Panjal Range.

The sediments deposited in the lake
are about 13800m in thickness known
as Quaternary sediments of Karewa
Group. These deposits known as
‘Karewas’ or ‘Karewa Group’ are largely
fluvial-lacustrine and glacial-fluvial-

For Question 191.---------------
Explanation:

Rock system of India

Based on the geological history of India it
is of four types viz. Archaean Rock System
(oldest) Purana Rock System Dravidian
Rock System and Aryan Rock System.

The Archaean rock system includes:

» Archaean Rocks: These are very
old primary rocks which have been
metamorphosed into gneiss and
schist. Bundelkhand Gneiss (Bellary
Gneiss) is the oldest among them.
Bengal gneiss and Nilgiri gneiss are
other examples of these rocks.

>» Dharwar Rocks: These are the
layered rocks formed after the erosion
and deposition of the Archean rocks.
These are highly metamorphosed and
fossils are not found inside. These
rocks are found in Dharwar and
Bellary districts of Karnataka
Aravalli range Balaghat Rewa
Chota Nagpur etc.

The Purana rock system includes:

» Cuddapah Rocks: These rocks have
been fonned by the erosion and
deposition of Dharwar rocks. These
are less metamorphosed but devoid
of fossils. These rocks are found in
Krishna valley Nallamalai hills area
Papaghani and Cheyar valleys.

>» Vindhyan Rocks: These rocks have
been formed after the formation of
Cuddappah rocks. These rocks are
spread from Chittorgarh of Rajasthan
to Sasaram of Bihar.

Dravidian Rock System (Palaeozoic) was
formed about 600 — 300 million years ago
and found in the Extra Peninsular
region (Himalayas and Ganga plain)
and are very rare in Peninsular
India. The rocks of Cambrian Ordovician
Silurian Devonian and Carboniferous
periods fall under the Dravidian system.

» Carboniferous rocks comprise mainly
of limestone shale and quartzite.
Mount Everest is composed of Upper

Carboniferous limestones. Coal
formation started in the Carboniferous
age.

Aryan Rock System includes Gondwana
System Jurassic System Deccan Trap
and the Tertiary System.

>» Gondwana Rocks: These are
the rocks formed in upper
Carboniferous to Jurassic era
hence these are especially important
for coal deposits. About 98% of the coal
deposits of India are found in these
rocks. these rocks are found in the
river valleys of Damodar Mahanadi
and Godavari and its tributaries.

» Jurassic system: The marine
transgression in the latter part of the
Jurassic gave rise to thick series of
shallow-water deposits in Rajasthan
and in Kuchchh. Coral limestone
sandstone conglomerates and shales
occur in Kuchchh.

> Deccan Trap: This was formed in
the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic
era due to volcanic eruption (Reunion
Hotspot) through fissure.

» Tertiary System: It is the most
significant period in India’s
geological history because the
Himalayas were born and India’s
present form came into being in
this period.

For Question 192.---------------
Explanation:

North Indian Plains

The Great North Indian plains are
homogeneous surfaces with an invisible
slope.

These are alluvial fertile plains formed by
the deposition process of the Himalayan
Rivers. Along with the Himalayan
Rivers the Vindhyan Rivers like are
also having a prominent role in making
the land fertile. It deposits a large number
of sediments along the foothills.

The Great North Indian plain is divided
into following subdivisions on the basis of
relief features:

» The Bhabar Plains lie to the south
of Shiwalik from Jammu to Assam.
The Bhabar tract consists of gravel
and un-assorted sediment deposits
and is not suitable for cultivation.


» The Terai Plains lies south to the
Bhabar tract. It is a marshy tract
with a malarial climate. The width of
the Terai tract is more in the eastern
region.

>» The Bhangar are older alluvial plain
which represents upland alluvial
tract. These areas are well-drained
and suitable for cultivation.

» The Khadar is new alluvial deposits
along the course of the river. It is
enriched by fresh deposits of silt every
year.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 195.---------------
Explanation:

Coasts of India

Eastern coastal plains are broader and less
steep due to delta formed by the east-flowing
rivers and absent of any geological events.
The western coastal plains are narrow
due to absence of riverine deltas and
steeper due to down warping of the
west coast in the past. Therefore Unlike
the Western Coast Eastern Coast does
not have natural ports. However many
artificial ports have been developed here.
Less or more rainfall does not have
any role in this.

Coastline of emergence is formed either by
an uplift of the land or by the lowering of
the sea level. Coastline of submergence is
an exact opposite case.

Bars spits lagoons salt marshes beaches
sea cliffs and arches are the typical
features of emergence which has been
experienced in the East Coast thus the
coastline of the East Coast is emergent. On
the contrary the west coast of India is
both emergent and submergent. The

Why India needs a Project Dolphin

The government is planning to launch a
programme called “Project Dolphin” along
the lines of “Project Tiger” to enhance the
population of these dolphins.

About the Gangetic river dolphin

Efforts made

The Gangetic river dolphins can only live
in freshwater are blind and catch their
prey in a unique manner using ultrasonic
sound waves.

The Gangetic river dolphins were officially
discovered in 1801 and are one of the oldest
creatures in the world along with some
species of turtles crocodiles and sharks
according to the World Wildlife Fund

(WWF).

They once lived in the Ganges-
Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-
Sangu river systems of Nepal India and
Bangladesh but are now mostly extinct
from many of its early distribution ranges
as per WWF.

In 2009 the Gangetic dolphin was declared
India’s National Aquatic animal. Gangetic
dolphin has been notified by the Assam as
the state aquatic animal too.

It is placed under the “endangered”
category by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

They are distributed across seven states
in India: Assam Uttar Pradesh Madhya
Pradesh Rajasthan Bihar Jharkhand
and West Bengal.

Their numbers have dwindled in the last
few decades mainly because of direct
killing habitat fragmentation by dams and
barrages and indiscriminate fishing.

dolphins?

Setting up of the Conservation Action Plan
forthe Gangetic Dolphin (2010-2020) which
has identified threats to Gangetic dolphins
and impact of river traffic irrigation canals
and depletion of prey-base on dolphin
populations.

Gangetic dolphins have been included in
Schedule -I of the Wildlife Protection Act
1972 which means they have the highest
degree of protection against hunting.

They are also one among the 21 species
identified under the centrally sponsored
scheme “Development of Wildlife
Habitat”.
Threats to Gangetic river dolphin

Pollution: It faces a number of threats
such as dumping of single-use plastics in
water bodies industrial pollution and
fishing.

Restrictive Flow of Water: The increase
in the number of barrages and dams is also
affecting their growth as such structures
impede the flow of water.

Poaching: Dolphins are also poached for
their flesh fat and oil which is used as a
prey to catch fish as an ointment and as a
supposed aphrodisiac.

Shipping & Dredging: It is also called
a blind dolphin because it doesn’t have an
eye lens and uses echolocation to navigate
and hunt.

It will be developed by Tripura Industrial
Development Corporation (TIDC) Ltd.

About-

The SEZ is being set-up at Paschim Jalefa
Sabroom South Tripura District which is
130 km away from Agartala.

It will be a Sector Specific Economic Zone
for Agro-Based Food Processing.

The estimated investment in the project
will be around 1550 Crore.

The SEZ is estimated to generate 12000
skilled jobs.

Rubber based industries textile and
Apparel Industries bamboo and Agri-food
Processing Industries will be set-up in the
SEZ.

Setting up of the SEZ in Sabroom will
open up new avenues to attract private
investment considering the proximity of
the Chittagong Port and construction of the
bridge across Feni River in South Tripura
which is underway.

After it is set up 100 percent Income
Tax exemption will be provided on export
income for SEZ units under Section 10AA


of the Income Tax Act for the first 5 years.

Also 50 percent exemption will be provided
for the next 5 years and 50 percent of the
ploughed back export profit for another 5
years.

SEZs-

A special economic zone (SEZ) is an area
in which the business and trade laws are
different from the rest of the country.

SEZs are located within a country’s
national borders and their aims include
increased trade balance employment
increased investment job creation and
effective administration.

To encourage businesses to set up
in the zone financial policies are
introduced. These policies typically

Special Economic Zones in India-

India was one of the first in Asia to recognize
the effectiveness of the Export Processing
Zone (KPZ) model in promoting exports
with Asia’s first EPZ set up in Kandla in
196

The second EPZ SEEPZ (Santa Cruz
Electronics Export processing Zone) was
set up in Maharashtra in 197

In April 2000 the Government of India
adopted a new policy framework titled
‘Export and Import Policy 2000’ for the
establishment of public private or joint
public-private SEZs.

India witnessed remarkable growth in
number of formal notified and operational
approvals post enactment of SEZ Act in
200 The spread of SEZs within the States
is to achieve balanced growth across all

The link between food nutrition diet and
non-communicable diseases

Junk food monster:

India urgently needs a robust law on
labelling and disclosure of nutritional
information on food packs.

The existing Food Safety Standards
(Packaging and Labelling) Regulations
2011 is too weak and ineffective.

Even some-thing as basic as salt is not
mandatorily disclosed.

But the statutory framework is just not
coming along clearly due to pressure from
the powerful junk food industry and the
resultant red tape.

In 2018 Food Safety and Standards
Authority of India (FSSAD) the country’s
food regulator set up an expert committee
to regulate junk food available in schools
following an order of the Delhi High
Court.

In 2014 the expert committee comprising
doctors nutritionists public health experts
civil society and industry suggested
labelling of calories sugar fat saturated
fat and salt on the front of food packs as
this would help people make an informed
choice about the food they eat.

D Prabhakaran committee suggested
resolving ambiguities on the correct serving
size of packed and fast foods and the exact
nutritional information people need.

Communicating

diseases

A lab study by the Centre for Science and
Environment has found extremely high
levels of salt fat and trans fat in junk
foods responsible for obesity and non-
communicable diseases like hypertension
diabetes and heart ailments.

Trans fats are deadly. Their intake must
be avoided to prevent heart diseases.

The new trend of unhealthy food habits
among the youth in India has put them
at a risk of developing obesity diabetes
heart attack -basically non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) accentuated by unhealthy
lifestyles.


NCDs are those diseases that are not
caused by an infection and not spread
through contact with another person. They
are the silent killers of our generation.
Nearly two out of three deaths in India
are due to NCDs with heart diseases and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) becoming the leading causes of
death in the country.

Explanation:

Evolution of the Himalayan rivers

During the Miocene period Shiwalik or
Indo-Brahma river traversed the entire
longitudinal extent of the Himalaya from
Assam to Punjab and finally discharged into
the Gulf of Sind The remarkable continuity
of the Shiwalik and its lacustrine origin and
alluvial deposits consisting of sands silt
clay boulders and conglomerates support
this viewpoint.

It is opined that in due course of time Indo—
Brahma river was dismembered into three
main drainage systems: (i) the Indus and
its five tributaries in the western part; (ii)
the Ganga and its Himalayan tributaries in
the central part; and (iii) the stretch of the
Brahmaputra in Assam and its Himalayan
tributaries in the eastern part.

The dismemberment was probably due to
the Pleistocene upheaval in the western
Himalayas including the (i) uplift of the
Potwar Plateau (Delhi Ridge) which acted
as the water divide between the Indus
and Ganga drainage systems. Likewise
(ii) the down thrusting of the Malda gap
area between the Rajmahal hills and
the Meghalaya plateau during the mid-
Pleistocene period diverted the Ganga and
the Brahmaputra systems to flow towards
the Bay of Bengal.

Evolution of the Peninsular rivers

The water divide in the peninsular India
due to (i) the Subsidence of the western
flank of the Peninsula leading to its
submergence below the sea during the
early tertiary period; (ii) Upheaval of the
Himalayas when the northern flank of
the Peninsular block was subjected to
subsidence and the consequent trough

These rivers like Kosi bring huge
amount of eroded materials that
block the course of the rivers and
hence the rivers shift.

>» Thecourse of these rivers is gently

West flowing rivers and delta formation

e The  west-flowing rivers of the
Peninsular India are fewer and
smaller as compared to their east-
flowing counterparts.

e Due to the earlier collision between
Indian and Eurasian Plates many
rifts/faults were created. Narmada
and Tapi flow through these rifts. This
causes the lack of denudation and
hence they do not form deltas.

e The west-flowing rivers have smaller
tributaries and that too of without
silt. This also causes the absence of
deltas.

For Question 223.---------------
Explanation:

Rivers System in India

Apart from originating from the two
major physiographic regions of India the
Himalayan and the Peninsular Rivers are
different from each other in many ways.

Most ofthe Himalayan Rivers are perennial.
It means that they have water throughout
the year. These rivers receive water from
rain as well as from melted snow from the
lofty mountains.

The two major Himalayan Rivers the Indus
and the Brahmaputra originate from the
north of the mountain ranges. They have
cut through the mountains making gorges.
The Himalayan Rivers have long courses
from their source to the sea.

They perform intensive erosional
activity in their upper courses and
carry huge loads of silt and sand. In
the middle and the lower courses these
rivers form meanders oxbow lakes and
many other depositional features in their
floodplains.

They also have well-developed deltas.

A large number of the Peninsular
Rivers are seasonal as their flow is

126


dependent on rainfall. During the dry
season even the large rivers have reduced
flow of water in their channels.

The Peninsular Rivers have shorter
and shallower courses as compared to
their Himalayan counterparts. However
some of them originate in the central
highlands and flow towards the west.

Most of the rivers of peninsular India
originate in the Western Ghats and flow
towards the Bay of Bengal.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 224.---------------
Explanation:

Indus River System

Indus River is great trans-Himalayan river
of South Asia. It is one of the longest rivers
in the world with a length of some 1800
miles (2900 km). Its total drainage area
is about 450000 square miles (1165000
square km) of which 175000 square miles
(453000 square km) lie in the Himalayan
ranges and foothills and the rest in the
semiarid plains of Pakistan.

The Indus originates in the Kailash range
in Tibet near Lake Manasarovar. It follows
a north-westerly course through Tibet.
It enters Indian Territory in Jammu and
Kashmir. It forms a picturesque gorge in
this part. Several tributaries - the Zaskar
the Shyok the Nubra and the Hunza join
it in the Kashmir region. It flows through
the regions of Ladakh Baltistan and Gilgit
and runs between the Ladakh Range and
the Zaskar Range. It crosses the Himalayas
through a 5181 m deep gorge near Attock
lying north of the Nanga Parbat and later
takes a bend to the south west direction
before entering Pakistan. It has a large
number of tributaries in both India and
Pakistan and has a total length of about
2880 km from the source to the point near
Karachi where it falls into the Arabian
Sea. The main tributaries of the Indus in
India are Jhelum Chenab Ravi Beas and
Sutlej.

The principal rivers of the Indus River
system are snow-fed. Their flow varies
greatly at different times of the year: the
discharge is at a minimum during the
winter months (December to February);
there is a rise of water in spring and early
summer (March to June); and floods occur
in the rainy season (July to September).
Occasionally there are devastating flash
floods. The Indus and its tributaries
receive all their waters in the hilly upper
parts of their catchments. Therefore their
flow is at a maximum where they emerge


out of the foothills and little surface flow
is added in the plains where evaporation
and seepage considerably reduce the flow
volume. On the other hand some water is
added by seepage in the period after the
monsoon months. In the main stream of
the Indus the water level is at its lowest
from mid December to mid-February.
After this the river starts rising slowly at
first and then more rapidly at the end of
March. The high-water level usually occurs
between mid-July and mid-August. The
river then falls rapidly until the beginning
of October when the water level subsides
more gradually.

What is Annular Solar Eclipse?

e An eclipse happens when the moon while
orbiting the Earth comes in between the
sun and the Earth due to which the moon
blocks the sun’s light from reaching the
Earth causing an eclipse of the sun or a
solar eclipse.

e It was visible from India Saudi Arabia
Qatar Malaysia Oman Singapore Sri
Lanka Mariana Islands and Borneo among
a few other places.

e There are three types of eclipses: one is
a total solar eclipse which is visible only
from a small area on Earth.

e People who are able to view the total solar
eclipse are in the centre of the moon’s
shadow as and when it hits the Earth.

e A total solar eclipse happens when the sun
moon and Earth are in a direct line.

e The second type of a solar eclipse is a
partial solar in which the shadow of the
moon appears on a small part of the sun.

e The third kind is an annular solar eclipse
which happens when the moon is farthest
from the Earth which is why it seems
smaller.

e In this type of an eclipse the moon does
not block the sun completely but looks like
a “dark disk on top of a larger sun-colored
disk” forming a “ring of fire”.

e Furthermore during a solar eclipse the
moon casts two shadows on the Earth the
first one is called the umbra which gets
smaller as it reaches the Earth.

Australia Fire

Wild bushfires have been ravaging
Australia for several weeks now. These
fires have been especially severe in the
New South Wales and Victoria.

The State declared a week-long state of
emergency in response to the escalating
disaster.

916 homes have been destroyed this season
363 more have been damaged.

Both New South Wales and Victoria have
given fire fighting authorities the power to
forcibly relocate people.

Bushfires in Australia impact extensive
areas and cause property damage and loss
of human life.

Some of Australia’s native flora has
evolved to rely on bushfires as a means
of reproduction and fire events are an
interwoven and an essential part of the
ecology of the continent.

For thousands of years Indigenous
Australians have used fire to foster
grasslands for hunting and to clear tracks
through dense vegetation.

Major firestorms that result in severe loss
of life are often named based on the day on
which they occur such as Ash Wednesday
and Black Saturday.

Some of the most intense extensive and
deadly bushfires commonly occur during
droughts and heat waves.

One type of wildfire is known as a bushfire
an uncontrolled fire that burns through
scrubland which is common to Australia.

Like all wildfires a bushfire places nature
and man under threat.

There are many factors that lead to a
bushfire or influence its spread. This
includes the type of fuel. Some grasses as
well as twigs can burn very quickly. On the
other hand large tree trunks don’t burn as
easily.


The moisture of the fuel is another critical
factor. Fuel that’s wet is unlikely to burn.
Similarly increased humidity decreases
the chances that a bushfire will start.

On the flipside lower humidity higher
temperature and drier conditions all help
ignite and spread a fire.

Wind plays a key part in the spread of
bushfires too. Wind provides much needed
oxygen for a fire.

A bushfire will spread up a hill much faster
than it will down a hill due to the processes
of convection and radiation.

It’s an explosive storm called pyro
cumulonimbus and it can inject particles
as high as 10 miles into the air.

During a fire heat and moisture from the
plants are released even when the fuel is
relatively dry.

Warm air is less dense than cold air so it
rises releasing the moisture and forming a
cloud that lifts and ends up a thunderstorm
started by fire.

It happens from time to time in Australia
and other parts of the world including
Canada.

Why this winter is extra cold in India

The unusually cold December this year
could just be another instance of extreme
climates becoming more and more frequent
a result of climate change. Across the
world the frequency and intensity of both
heat waves and cold waves have increased
in the last few years.

Extreme cold temperatures rainfall and
intense fog in the months of December
and January are witnessed by north and
northwest India.

Every year in the second half of December
and the first half of January temperatures
routinely drop to 2-4°C at some point of the
day in many places in north and northwest
India.

In December the maximum daily
temperature does not rise beyond 16-18°C
in most of Punjab Haryana Himachal
Pradesh and western Uttar Pradesh.

In Delhi and northern Rajasthan daily
maximum temperatures are usually not
over 20-22°C for most of December.
This has happened only four times in the
last 118 years and the IMD has said this
month would most likely become the second
coldest December for Delhi since 190

This is already the longest such spell for
December since 199

A cold-day condition is said to prevail when
the maximum temperature during the day
is at least 5°C below normal.

If the maximum temperature is at least
5°C below normal it is classified as a
severe cold day.

Scientists say there is nothing unusual
in the climatic conditions that influence
temperatures in this region at this time of
the year.

The cold wave usually arrives from the
west through the Western Disturbance
wind system.

This system is also responsible for causing
rains in northern and northwestern parts
after having picked up moisture on its way
from the Mediterranean Sea.

The intensity of the cold also depends on
the amount of snowfall that happens in
Jammu and Kashmir Ladakh Himachal
Pradesh and nearby areas.

They combine in different ways to produce
different kinds of winter conditions.

The frequency and intensity of both heat
waves and cold waves have increased in
the last few years and are predicted to
increase further. The same is the case with
extreme rainfall and drought.

Flow of north-westerly winds over
northwest India that too over much lower
levels further fuelled the chill factor
making the days much colder than normal
during December.

This extended cold spell has been triggered
due to low stratus clouds that are blanketed
over a large geographical area — between
Pakistan cutting across India and running
up to Bangladesh.

For Question 228.---------------
Explanation:

Factors influencing the climate of India

Latitude: The Tropic of Cancer passes
through the central part of India in the
east-west direction. Thus the northern
part of India lies in the sub-tropical and
temperate zone and the part lying south
of the Tropic of Cancer falls in the tropical
zone. The area north of the Tropic of Cancer
being away from the equator experiences
an extreme climate with a high daily and
annual range of temperature.

The Himalayas: The towering mountain
provides an invincible shield to protect the
subcontinent from the cold northern winds.
These cold and chilly winds originate near
the Arctic circle and blow across central
and eastern Asia. The Himalayas also trap
the monsoon winds forcing them to shed
their moisture within the subcontinent.

Distribution of Land and Water: India is
surrounded by the Indian Ocean on three
sides in the south and girdled by a high and
continuous mountain-wall in the north. As
compared to the landmass water heats
up or cools down slowly. This differential
heating of land and sea creates different
air pressure zones in different seasons in
and around the Indian subcontinent. The
difference in air pressure causes a reversal
in the direction of monsoon winds.

Distance from the Sea: With a long
coastline large coastal areas have an
equable climate. Areas in the interior of
India are far away from the moderating
influence of the sea. Such areas have
extremes of climate. People of Mumbai and
the Konkan coast have hardly any idea of
extremes of temperature and the seasonal
rhythm of weather. On the other hand the
seasonal contrasts in weather at places in




the interior of the country such as Delhi
Kanpur and Amritsar affect the entire
sphere of life.

Temperature decreases with

mountains are cooler than places on the
plains. For example Agra and Darjiling
are located on the same latitude but the
temperature of January in Agra is 16°C
whereas it is only 4°C in Darjiling.

Relief: The physiography or relief of India
also affects the temperature air pressure
direction and speed of the wind and the
amount and distribution of rainfall. The
windward sides of the Western Ghats and
Assam receive high rainfall during June-
September whereas the southern plateau
remains dry due to its leeward situation
along the Western Ghats.

For Question 230.---------------
Explanation:

Rainfall in Winter Monsoon

Winter monsoons do not cause rainfall as
they move from land to the sea. So most
parts of India do not have rainfall in the
winter season. However there are some
exceptions to it:




The months of September and October
are known for retreating monsoons
since the southwest monsoon has
become weak due to the southward
shift in ITCZ. It is associated with
rainfall on the Coromandel Coast due
to cyclonic depressions that develop
over the Andaman Sea.

During October and November
northeast monsoon which is in-sync
with the North-East Monsoon while
crossing over the Bay of Bengal picks
up moisture and causes torrential
rainfall over the Tamil Nadu coast
southern Andhra Pradesh southeast
Karnataka and southeast Kerala.

These two factors make October and
November as the wettest months in
Tamil Nadu.

In northwestern India some weak
temperate cyclones from the Mediterranean
Sea cause rainfall in Punjab Haryana
Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh. It is
called the western disturbance.

For Question 231.---------------
Explanation:

Summer Season in India

It is also referred to as the pre-monsoon
period. High temperature and low
humidity are the chief characteristics.

A strong  convectional movements
related to the westerly jet stream lead to
thunderstorms in the eastern and north-
eastern part of the country. They are called
norwesters.

They are sometimes useful for tea jute and
rice cultivation. In Assam these storms are
known as ‘Barodoli Chheerha’. The period
of maximum occurrence of these storms is
the month of Vaisakh (mid-March to mid-
April) and hence they are locally known as
Kalabaisakhis the black storms or a mass
of dark clouds of Vaisakha.

In the south the thunderstorms
occur in Kerala (Mango Showers) and
adjoining parts of Karnataka (Blossom
Showers) and Tamil Nadu particularly
during evenings and nights.

is marked by clear skies and a rise in
temperature. Owing to the conditions
of high temperature and humidity the

 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 232.---------------
Explanation:

Walker cell and Indian Monsoon

It is observed that there is an east-west
atmospheric circulation over the tropical
oceanic regions. Such circulation in the
Pacific Ocean is generally called walker
cell. However many scientists use the term
‘walker cell’ for all east-west circulations in
different oceans.

Walker cell is associated with southern
oscillation and its strength fluctuates with
that of the Southern Oscillation Index
(SOD.

With a high positive SOI there would
be a zone of low atmospheric pressure
over Australia and the Indonesian
archipelago. The rising air from this
regiondeflectsinthe upper atmosphere
in both directions towards Africa and
South America.

In the Indian Ocean the air descends
downat high-pressure zone from where
surface winds blow as Southwest
monsoon towards the Indian sub-
continent in summers.

During La-Nina Indian ocean branch
of walker cell get strengthen and
surface winds are more intense. La
Nina condition is generally associated
with good monsoon.

During the appearance of El-Nino or
negative SOI the ascending branch of
the Walker cell shifts to the central regions
of the Pacific Ocean from the west pacific
region.

In a result the Indian Ocean cell shifts
towards the east. The surface winds or
Southwest monsoon winds are weaker than
normal conditions.

 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 233.---------------
Explanation:

The months of April and May are
generally dry and rainless in spite of high
temperatures (low pressure on land) and
high evaporation.

The reasons for the absence of the S-W
monsoon in March-May are as follows:

During the summer season in the Northern
Hemisphere low-pressure areas develop at
the ground surface near north-west India
due to intense heating of ground surface
during April May and June.


As the position of the upper air jet
stream i.e. Sub Tropical Jet stream
(STJ) is maintained above the surface
low pressure to the south of Himalayas
the dynamic anti-cyclonic conditions
(strong divergence) persist over north-
west India.

The winds descending from the upper air
high pressure [because of the ridge of STJ]
obstructs the ascent of winds from the
surface low-pressure areas with the result
that the weather remains warm and dry.

 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 235.---------------
Explanation:

Heat Waves

As the sun moves northwards after March
equinox central India heats up during April
and northwest India during May. This heat
is transferred to eastern regions through
advection and resulting in heatwave
conditions in these areas also.

Anti-cyclone conditions in the Bay of Bengal
prevent the extension of maritime influence
in the coastal regions and leading to a rise
in temperature there also. The reason
behind heatwaves is believed to be
a sudden increase in the atmospheric
pressure due to the descent of the
heavier air from the upper levels of
the atmosphere happening especially
over interior parts of the country.

Regions of northwest India like Western
UP Haryana and Rajasthan where it is
given name ‘loo’ face regular heatwaves.
Interior regions of other states like Odisha
Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal also
face heatwave conditions.

In recent years because of the global
warming effect frequent El-Nino the
events of heatwaves have increased and in
the year 2015 more than 2000 people died
because of heatstroke mostly in the regions
of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

1 Correct option: (b)

For Question 237.---------------
Explanation:
El]-Nino and La-Nina

Nifo and La Nifia are opposite phases of
what is known as the El Nifio-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. The ENSO


cycle is a scientific term that describes
the fluctuations in temperature between
the ocean and atmosphere in the east-
central Equatorial Pacific (approximately
between the International Date Line
and 120 degrees West). In a normal
year a surface low pressure develops
in the region of northern Australia and
Indonesia and a high-pressure system over
the coast of Peru. As a result the trade
winds over the Pacific Ocean move strongly
from east to west. The easterly flow of
the trade winds carries warm surface
waters westward bringing convective
storms (thunderstorms) to Indonesia and
coastal Australia. Along the coast of Peru
cold bottom cold nutrient-rich water wells
up to the surface to replace the warm water
that is pulled to the west.

During the El Nifio the normal low-
pressure system is replaced by a weak
high in the western Pacific (the southern
oscillation). This change in pressure pattern
causes the trade winds to be reduced. This
reduction allows the equatorial counter-
current (current along with doldrums) to
accumulate warm ocean water along the
coastlines of Peru and Ecuador leading to
weakening of the southwest monsoon over
the Indian subcontinent.

Climatically the development of an El Nifio
brings drought to the western Pacific rains
to the equatorial coast of South America
and convective storms and hurricanes to
the central Pacific. The warmer waters had
a devastating effect on marine life existing
off the coast of Peru and Ecuador. Fish
catches off the coast of South America were
lower than in the normal year (Because
there is no upwelling). Severe droughts
occur in Australia Indonesia India and
southern Africa. Heavy rains in California
Ecuador and the Gulf of Mexico.

1 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 238.---------------
Explanation:

Modern Theory of the origin of the
Monsoon

According to this theory the monsoon is
simply a modification of the planetary
winds of the tropics.

The theory is based on the migration of
ITCZ based on seasons

The front where the south-west monsoons
meet the north-east trade winds is known
as the Monsoon Front (ITCZ). Rainfall
occurs along this front. In the month of

140


July the ITCZ shifts to 20°- 25° N latitude
and is located in the Indo-Gangetic Plain
and the south-west monsoons blow from
the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.
The ITCZ in this position is often called the
Monsoon Trough [maximum rainfall].

Jet stream Theory is the latest theory
regarding the origin of the monsoons and
has earned worldwide acceptance from the
meteorologists.

Sub-Tropical Jet stream plays a significant
role in both hindering the monsoon winds
as well as in the quick onset of monsoons.

It is a narrow band of fast-moving air
flowing from west to east

STJ in northern hemisphere flows between
25° to 35° N in the upper troposphere at a
height of about 12-14 km

Polar Jet has no influence on Indian
monsoons

In winter STJ flows along the southern
slopes of the Himalayas but in summer it
shifts northwards rather dramatically and
flows along the northern edge of Himalayas
in early June and in late summer (July-
August) along the northern edge of the
Tibetan Plateau.

The periodic movement of the Jet stream is
often the indicator of the onset (STJ shits to
the north of Himalayas in a matter of days)
and subsequent withdrawal (STJ returns
back to its position — south of Himalayas)
of the monsoon.

The northward movement of the subtropical
jet is the first indication of the onset of the
monsoon over India.

Tropical easterly jet stream (TEJ) that
branch off from anticyclone developed
over Tibet sometimes reaches to the
tip of Peninsular India. Apart from
this Jet speed winds are also reported
over other parts of Peninsular. This
jet descends over the Indian Ocean
and intensifies its high-pressure cell
known as Mascarene High.

Itisfromthis high-pressure cellthatthe
onshore winds start blowing towards
the thermally induced low-pressure
area developed in the northern part of
the Indian subcontinent. After crossing
the equator such winds become south-
westerly and are known as the south-
westerly summer monsoon.

This Easterly Jetstream dies in the
winter.


1 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 239.---------------
Explanation:

The features of the Monsoon rainfall in
India are as follows:

Spatial distributionofrainfallislargely
governed by relief or topography. For
instance the windward side of the Western
Ghats registers a rainfall of over 250 cm
while the leeward side receives much less
rainfall. Again the heavy rainfall in the
northeastern states can be attributed
to their hill ranges and the Eastern
Himalayas. Rainfall ranges from 20 cm in
western Rajasthan to more than 400 cm in
certain parts of Western Ghats and North-
East India. Less rainfall in the Rajasthan
is because the South-West monsoon winds
coming from the Arabian Sea are parallel
to the Aravali range there.

The monsoon rainfall has a declining trend
with increasing distance from the sea.

Rainfall decreases from east to west in
plains as one branch of monsoon enters
from the eastern side. Kolkata receives
119 cm Allahabad 76 cm and Delhi 56 cm
only.

Breaks in rainfall are related to the
cyclonic depressions mainly formed
at the head of the Bay of Bengal and
their crossing into the mainland. Besides
the frequency and intensity of these
depressions the passage followed by them
determines the spatial distribution of
rainfall.

The rains sometimes end considerably
earlier than usual causing great damage
to standing crops and making the sowing
of winter crops difficult.

For Question 240.---------------
Explanation:

Role of Indian Ocean Dipole in South-West
Monsoon

Indian Ocean Dipoleis a recently discovered
phenomenon that has a significant influence
on Indian monsoons.

Indian Ocean Dipole is an SST (Sea
Surface Temperature) anomaly that occurs
occasionally in Northern or Equatorial
Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is defined
by the difference in sea surface temperature
between two areas (or poles hence a
dipole) — a western pole in the Arabian Sea
(western Indian Ocean) and an eastern
pole in the eastern Indian Ocean south of
Indonesia.
e With a positive IOD winds over the Indian
Ocean blow from east to west (from Bay of
Bengal towards Arabian Sea). This results
in the Arabian Sea as much warmer and
eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia
becoming colder and dry.

e Inthenegative dipole year reverse happens
which makes Indonesia much warmer and
rainier.

e Positive IOD is good for Indian Monsoons as
more evaporation occurs in warm water.

e Similar to ENSO the
component of the IOD is named as
Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation
(EQUINOO)(Oscillation of pressure cells
between Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea).

atmospheric

e During the positive phase of the ‘Equatorial
Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO)’
there is enhanced cloud formation and
rainfall in the western part of the equatorial
ocean near the African coast while such
activity is suppressed near Sumatra.

Role of Somali Jet

e The progress of the southwest monsoon
towards India is greatly aided by the onset
of the Somali jet that transits Kenya
Somalia and the Sahel.

e It strengthens permanent high near
Madagascar and also helps to drive S-W
monsoons towards India at a greater pace
and intensity

e As the strong winds drive away the
surface coastal waters towards the
east extremely cold water (Cold
Somali Current) from the depths of
the sea rise upwards to preserve the
continuity of mass.

1 Correct Option: (d)
For Question 241.---------------
Explanation:

Formation of the North-East Monsoon

e The north-east monsoon commonly known
as winter monsoon blows from land to sea.

e Asthe Sun moves southwards due to which
the following phenomena occur.

> ITCZ moves southward.

>» Formation of the High-Pressure
belt over Tibet due to cooling of the
Plateau. This leads to the end of the
Somali Jet and Tropical Easterly Jet
stream.

» Subtropical Jetstream returns back
in its original position i.e. over Indian
Peninsula south of the Himalayas.


>» The Walker Cell which was formed and
strong in Summer gets weakened.

e All these factors aid the movement of the
Nort-East Trade wind and cold air mass
from the Siberia and Tibet into India and
the Bay of Bengal. This is called North-
East Monsoon(due to reversal of wind).

e This cold and moisture-free wind when
blows over the Bay of Bengal its humidity
increases and thus the rainfall over Tamil
Nadu.

e The Tamil Nadu coast is situated parallel
to the Bay of Bengal branch of southwest
monsoon.

e Itliesin the rainshadow area of the Arabian
Sea branch of the south-west monsoon.

e In spite of this the moisture-laden S-W

Explanation:

Tropical wet

e A tropical rainy climate covers regions
experiencing persistent warm or high
temperatures which normally stay above
18°C (64°F). India hosts two climatic
subtypes that fall under that group.

e The most humid the tropical wet monsoon
climate covers a strip of southwestern
lowlands abutting the Malabar Coast


the Western Ghats and southern Assam.
That climate prevails in India’s two island
territories Lakshadweep and the Andaman
and Nicobar Islands.

Most rainfall occurs between May and
November adequate for the maintenance
of lush forests and other vegetation
throughout the remainder of the year.

December to March represent the driest
months when days with precipitation are
rare. The heavy monsoon rains create the
extremely biodiverse tropical wet forests of
those regions.

India commonly experiences a tropical wet
and dry climate. Significantly drier than
tropical wet zones it prevails over most
of inland peninsular India except for a
semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western
Ghats.

Long Winter and early summers typically
bring dry periods with temperatures
averaging above 18°C (64°F). Indians
experience exceptionally hot Summers;
temperatures in low-lying areas may
exceed 50°C (122°F) during May leading to
heat waves that occasionally kill hundreds
of Indians.

The rainy season lasts from June to
September; annual rainfall averages
between 750-1500 millimetres (30-59 in)
across the region. Once the dry northeast
monsoon begins in September most
precipitation in India falls on Tamil Nadu
leaving other states comparatively dry.

For Question 244.---------------
Explanation:

Southwest Monsoon

The southwest summer monsoon a four-
month period when massive convective
thunderstorms dominate India’s weather
constitutes the Earth’s most valuable wet
season. Resulting from the southeast trade
winds originating from a high-pressure
mass centered over the southern Indian
Ocean a low-pressure region centered over
South Asia attracts monsoons.

They give rise to surface winds that ferry
humid air into India from the southwest.
Those inflows ultimately result from a
northward shift of the local jet stream
which itself results from rising summer
temperatures over Tibet and the Indian
subcontinent.

The void left by the jet stream which
switches from a route just south of the
Himalayas to one tracking north of Tibet
then attracts warm humid air.


The high summer temperature difference
between Central Asia and the Indian
Ocean embodies the main factor behind
that shift.

Accompanied by a seasonal excursion
of the normally equatorial intertropical
convergence zone (ITCZ) a low-pressure
belt of highly unstable weather moves
northward towards India.

That system intensified to its present
strength as a result of the Tibetan Plateau’s
uplift accompanying the Eocene—Oligocene
transition event a major episode of global
cooling and aridification occurring 34—49
mya.

The southwest monsoon arrives in two
branches: the Bay of Bengal branch and
the Arabian Sea branch. The latter extends
toward a low-pressure area over the Thar
Desert measuring roughly three times
stronger than the Bay of Bengal
branch.

The monsoon usually breaks over Indian
Territory by around May 25 when it
lashes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
in the Bay of Bengal. It strikes the Indian
mainland around June 1 supplies over 80
percent of India’s annual rainfall.

First appearing near the Malabar Coast
of Kerala. By June 9 it reaches Mumbai;
it appears over Delhi by June 2 The
Bay of Bengal branch which hugs
the Coromandal Coast between Cape
Comorin and Orissa swerves to the
northwest. The Arabian Sea _ branch
moves northeast towards the Himalayas.

By the first week of July the entire country
experiences monsoon rain; on average
South India receives more rainfall
than North India. Yet Northeast India
receives the most precipitation. Monsoon
clouds begin retreating from North India
by the end of August; it withdraws from
Mumbai by October  As India further cools
during September the southwest monsoon
weakens. By the end of November it has
left the country.

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 245.---------------
Explanation:

Seasonal Rhythm

During the winter season the westerly
jet streams sets in on the south of the
Himalayas due to the shift of the ITCZ
(Inter Tropical Convergence Zone)
southward. These jet streams often bring
the low pressure depression created over
the Mediterranean Sea to Himalayan region
while its journey from Mediterranean Sea
to Himalayas the moisture content gets
augmented by Caspian Sea and Persian
Gulf. They even reach up to Arunachal
Pradesh. Due to orographic upliftment they
cause precipitation in the form of snowfall.
After the passage of the disturbance
widespread fog and cold waves set in
the region thus lowering the minimum
temperature by 5°C to 10°C below the
normal average. The range of diurnal
temperature increases and winters become
more severe. Haze is common in morning
and evening. These situations cause great
problems to day to day activities. The roads
get blocked commercial setups cannot work
due to snow cover creating difficulty flights
are affected and the people struggle to get
everyday requirements and groceries.

The frequencies of western disturbances
vary from year to year but on an average 3
to 5 disturbance per month are experienced.
The average precipitation during the
three months of winter season i.e. from
December to February is about 60cm
in the Himalayan region. The eastern
Himalayan region also gets rainfall
from the north east monsoon. Although
it is not so significant as the north east
monsoon winds are coming from land and
do not have sufficient moisture content due
to lack of source but the combined effect
of western disturbances and north east
monsoon causes an average precipitation of
about 50 cm in Sikkim Arunachal Pradesh
and Assam.


climate model. Before the onset of the
south Asian monsoon descending flow
in the mid-troposphere which can be
considered as a suppressor against
precipitation prevails over northern
India.

Jet Stream Theory

» This theory tries to explain the
establishment of both the NE and
SW Monsoons as well their unique
features like bursting and variability.
The jet streams are a system of upper-
air westerlies. It gives rise to slowly
moving upper-air waves with 250
knots winds in some air streams.

> Over India a subtropical westerly jet
develops in the winter season which
is replaced by the tropical easterly
jet in the summer season. The high
temperature over the Tibetan Plateau
as well as over Central Asia in general
during the summer is believed to
be the critical factor leading to the
formation of the tropical easterly jet
over India in summer. The mechanism
affecting monsoon is that the westerly
jet causes high pressure over northern
parts of the subcontinent during the
winter. This results in the north to
south flow of the winds in the form of
the NE Monsoon. With the northwards
shift of the vertical sun this jet shifts
northwards too. The intense heat over
the Tibetan Plateau coupled with
associated terrain features of high
altitude of the plateau etc. generate
the tropical easterly jet over Central

1 Correct Option: (a)
India. This jet creates a low pressure
zone over the northern Indian plains
influencing the wind flow towardsthese
plains assisting the establishment of
the SW Monsoon.

For Question 246.---------------
Explanation:

Factors Affecting Indian Monsoon
e Tibet Plateau (TP)

» Itisthe most mountainousin the world e Tropical easterly jet

with a mean height that exceeds 4000
m above sea level. The mechanical
effect of the plateau has determinative
roles upon the formation of a regional
climate system in Asia.

>» The thermal effect of the plateau may
profoundly affect the atmospheric
circulation as well because the sensible
and latent heat fluxes from TP reach a
higher altitude than its surroundings.
The atmosphere above TP is heated
more strongly than the surrounding
atmosphere at the same level.

» The roles of the Tibetan Plateau (TP)
upon the transition of precipitation in
the South Asian summer monsoon are
investigated using asimplifiedregional

> Due to low pressure over Tibetan
plateau high pressure exists in upper
troposphere. Due to high pressure
tropical easterly jet stream blow from
Tibetan plateau to Mascrene high
(low pressure at troposphere) near
Madagascar. This helps in sudden
onset of monsoon.

Subtropical westerly jet stream

>» Subtropical westerly jet stream flows
entirely south of Himalayas over
north India. (during winter). They
form depressions and high pressure
over northern India.

e During June-July-August due to creation of
high pressure at Mascrene high basin air
diverges due to which it goes towards horn
of Africa. Here it is divided into two parts
- one goes towards Africa and another goes
towards Indian subcontinent.]

» It is a low level jet stream (appear

Refugee Agency and the Government of
Switzerland.

e Globally more than two-thirds of all
refugees come from five countries: Syria
(7 million) Afghanistan (7 million)
South Sudan (3 million) Myanmar (1
million) and Somalia (9 million).

e According to the UN by the end of 2018
there were around 78 million people
around the world who had left their
home countries because of conflict and
persecution. Of these 78 million roughly
30 million are refugees.

e Countries in the developed regions host
16 per cent of refugees; one-third of the
refugee population (7 million people) are
in the Least Developed Countries.

e The largest host countries are Turkey (7
million) Pakistan (4 million) Uganda
(2 million) Sudan (1 million) and
Germany (1 million).

e According to the UN’s Global Trends report
there are 37000 new displacements every
day.
In 2018 136 million people were
newly displaced due to conflict and or
persecution.

It was affirmed by the United Nations
General Assembly in December 201
It represents the determination of the

Operation Twist

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced
simultaneous sale and purchase of
government bonds. RBI will sell short-
term bonds of 710000 crore it will also
purchase long-term securities of the same
value. With RBI’s Operation Twist the
net liquidity in the system will remain
unchanged.

Operation Twist of United States: RBI’s
move resembles the 2011 Operation Twist
of the US Federal Reserve Bank. The Fed
had swapped short-term bonds for longer-
term debt. US first attempted this exercise
in 196 At that time the “twist” was a
new dance craze sparked by singer
Chubby Checker. Since then this exercise
has carried this name.

The idea is to twist the yield curve: The
yield curve is a graph that plots the yields
of government securities (or other financial
securities) of different maturities.

>» The yield is the per-year return
an investor can earn on a financial
security by staying invested in it till
maturity.

>» When acentral bank buys government
securities the prices go up. At a
higher price the yields or the returns
come down as the interest paid on the
securities stays the same.

>» Vice versa when the bank sells
government securities the prices fall
and the return or the yield on the
security goes up.

» This creates a visual effect of a twist
in the yield curve and the yield curve
will flatten.

Benefits of RBI’s Operation Twist:
>» Yield anomaly corrected

>» Long-term borrowing will become
cheaper

>» Spur bank lending private borrowing

H-1B visas

The US government had recently said that
it is planning to curb the distribution
of H-1B visa to Indians. The objective
is to better protect US workers and
wages and save them from competition
from workers arriving from outside
countries like India and China.

H-1B visa:

Green Card.

RREEEREEEEE


>» H-1B visa has its roots in the H1 visa
of the Immigration and Nationality
Act; which split between H-1A (for

Who will be worst hit: Worst hit by
the new H1B bill will be Indian tech
companies such as Infosys TCS and
Wipro as well as US tech giants like
Apple Facebook and Google who use the
H1B visa to fill positions that cannot be
filled by American workers.

India has been the only country that
takes 70 per cent of the 85000 H-1B

Drake Passage and “The Impossible Row”

project

e In a first six rowers from four countries
crossed the Drake Passage in just under
two weeks after pushing off from the
southern tip of South America.

e The Passage is located between Cape
Horn at the tip of South America and the
Antarctic Peninsula.

e Thisis the first completely human-powered
crossing of the passage.

e The project was dubbed “The Impossible
Row” for which the team departed
from Cape Horn in Chile and arrived at
Primavera Base on San Martin Land on
the Antarctic Peninsula.

e The passage is named after Sir Francis
Drake who was the first Englishman to
circumnavigate the globe.

e The passage has an average depth of about
11000 feet with deeper regions going up
to over 15600 feet near the northern and
southern boundaries.

e The Drake Passage is considered one of the
roughest waterways in the world because
here layers of cold seawater from the
south and warm seawater from the north
collide to form powerful eddies which when
combined with strong winds and storms
can be treacherous for those attempting to
navigate it.

e It is also the narrowest stretch in the
Southern Ocean and spans approximately
800 km between the southern tip of South
America and the northern tip of the West
Antarctic Peninsula.

e NASA describes the waters of the passage
as “notoriously turbulent unpredictable
and frequented by icebergs and sea ice.

Bibek Debroy and not Wadwa committee
in 2015 has noted that “departmentalism”
is a major problem in the Railway system
and recommended merging of all services
into one.

Supplementary Notes

Recently the Cabinet recently approved to
trim the Railway Board and merge service
cadres.

The Cabinet recently approved trimming
of the Railway Board the powerful body
that governs the Indian Railways. From
nine the Board will now have only five
Members.

The Cabinet also decided to merge all
central service cadres of Railways
officers into a single Indian Railways
Management Service (IRMS). Now
any eligible officer could occupy any post
including Board Member posts irrespective
of training and specialisation since they
will all belong to IRMS.

The five members of the Board other
than a Chairman-cum-CEO will now be
the Members Infrastructure Finance
Rolling Stock Track and Operations and
Business Development. The Board will also
have independent members who will be
industry experts with at least 30 years of
experience but in non-executive roles only
attending Board meetings.

The move has led to protests from serving
civil servants prompting the Railway
Board to reach out to them to allay their
concerns.

Present System in Railways

The Indian Railways is governed by a pool
of officers among whom engineers are
recruited after the Indian Engineering
Service Examination and civil servants
through the Civil Services Examination.
The civil servants are in the Indian
Railway Traffic Service (RTS) Indian
Railway Accounts Service (IRAS) and
Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS).
The engineers are in five technical service
cadres — Indian Railway Service of
Engineers (IRSE) Indian Railway Service
of Mechanical Engineers (IRSME) Indian
Railway Service of Electrical Engineers
(IRSEE) Indian Railway Service of Signal
Engineers (IRSSE) and the Indian Railway
Stores Service (IRSS).

Until the 1950s the Railways system
was run by officers from just three main
streams: Traffic Civil Engineering and


Mechanical. The other streams emerged as
separate services over time.

Need for Reform

There are 8 Group A services in Indian
Railways (IR) — IRPS (Indian Railway
Personnel Service) IRTS (Indian Railway
Traffic Service) IRSS (Indian Railway
Stores Service) IRSME (ndian Railway
Service of Mechanical Engineers) IRSEE
(Indian Railway Service of Electrical
Engineers) IRSSE (Indian Railway Service
of Signal Engineers) IRSE (Indian Railway
Service of Engineers) and IRAS (Indian
Railway Accounts Service). Five—IRSME
IRSEE IRSSE IRSS and IRSE—are so-
called technical services recruited through
an engineering service examination
conducted by UPSC. Three—IRPS IRTS
and IRAS—are non-technical recruited
through the civil service examination
conducted by UPSC. It has led to inter-
departmental rivalry. The government
wants to end inter-departmental rivalries
which it says have been hindering growth
for decades. Railway Minister Piyush
Goyal said departments were working
“in silos”.

Unification has been recommended by
several committees—Prakash Tandon
(1994) Khanna (1998) Rakesh Mohan
(2001) Sam Pitroda (2012) and Bibek
Debroy (2015). Prakash Tandon
Committee recommended a single service.
A Gupta-Narain Committee (1994) set up
to examine feasibility of implementing this
single service idea questioned whether
this could be done.

Bibek Debroy committee in 2015 has
noted that “departmentalism” is a
major problem in the system. Most
committees have said merger of the services
in some form would be a solution. The
Debroy report recommended merging
of all services to create two distinct
services: Technical and Logistics. But
it did not say how to merge the existing
officers.

A separate exam under the Union Public
Service Commission is proposed to be
instituted in 2021 to induct IRMS officers.

For Question 277.---------------
Explanation:

Malthusian Theory of Population

It is one of the three most popular theories
of population viz. Malthusian Theory
Optimum Theory and the Theory of
Demographic Transition.

Published in 1798 by Thomas Robert
Malthus the theory explains’ the
relationship between the growth in food
supply and in population.

According to this theory the human
population increases in geometrical
progression and if unchecked doubles
itself every 25 years. On the other hand
the food supply increases in a slow
arithmetical progression due to the
operation of the law of diminishing
returns based on the supposition that the
supply ofland is constant. And ifunchecked
the population tends to outrun food supply
thus creating an imbalance.

Malthus was severely criticized for his
narrow and pessimistic views.

For instance his idea that population
increases in geometrical progression in 25
years have not been proved empirically.

His doctrine advocates that food
supply increases in arithmetical
progression but he underestimated
the technological advancements
of the force of production through
controlling nature over time.

Further his suggested preventive
measures (by human themselves) such as
late marriage celibacy moral restraint
etc. or the positive measures (by nature)
such as vice misery famine war disease
pestilence floods etc. to check the
population growth are very pessimistic.

UN Population Fund

The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) started
operations in 1969 to assume a leading
role within the UN system in promoting
population programs based on the human
right of individuals and couples to freely
determine the size of their families.

At the International Conference on
Population and Development (Cairo
1994) its mandate was fleshed out in
greater detail to give more emphasis to the
gender and human rights dimensions of
population issues and UNFPA was given
the lead role in helping countries carry out

 Correct Option: (a)

For Question 281.---------------
Explanation:

Approaches to Human Development

There are four approaches to human
development viz. Income Approach
Welfare Approach Basic Needs Approach
and Capability Approach.

Income Approach is one of the oldest
approaches to human development. Human
development is seen as being linked to
income. The idea is that the level of income
reflects the level of freedom an individual
enjoys. Higher the level of income the
higher is the level of human development.

Welfare Approach looks at human
beings as beneficiaries or targets of all
development activities. The approach
argues for higher government expenditure
on education health social secondary and
amenities. People are not participants in
development but only passive recipients.
The government is responsible for
increasing levels of human development by
maximizing expenditure on welfare.

Basic Needs Approach was initially
proposed by the International Labour
Organisation (ILO). Six basic needs
i.e: health education food water supply
sanitation and housing were identified.


The question of human choices is ignored
and the emphasis is on the provision of
basic needs of defined sections.

Capability Approach is associated
with Prof. Amartya Sen. Building
human capabilities in the areas of health
education and access to resources is the
key to increasing human development.

 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 282.---------------
Explanation:

Crop Productivity and Intensity

Crop Intensity refers to raising a number
of crops from the same field during one
agriculture year. The arable land can
hardly be stretched further in countries
like India. Therefore it is essential to
produce more than one crop in a year. The
optimum agricultural use of land is termed
as crop intensity.

Crop Intensity = Gross Cropped Area/Net
Sown Area x10

The present cropping intensity of
India is 136%.

Crop productivity means the amount of
production of crops per hectare or per
worker.

In the areas of extensive agriculture
per worker productivity is high
whereas in the areas of intensive
agriculture per hectare productivity
is high.

But India is lagging behind under both
these conditions as the agricultural
practices have not developed sufficiently.
Moreover per worker and per hectare
productivity is high only in the Green
revolution confined areas.

For Question 286.---------------
Explanation:

Types of agriculture and their main
location

Based on methods of farming different
types of crops are grown and livestock
raised. The following are the main
agricultural systems.

Subsistence Agriculture: Subsistence
agriculture is one in which the farming
areas consume all or nearly so of the
products locally grown. It can be grouped
into two categories — Primitive Subsistence
Agriculture and Intensive Subsistence
Agriculture. Primitive subsistence
agriculture or shifting cultivation is widely
practiced by many tribes in the tropics
especially in Africa south and central
America and southeast Asia. Intensive
Subsistence Agriculture is largely


found in densely populated regions of
monsoon Asia.

Plantation Agriculture: Plantation
agriculture was introduced by _ the
Europeans in colonies situated in the
tropics. Some of the important plantation
crops are tea coffee cocoa rubber
cotton oil palm sugarcane bananas and
pineapples etc.

Extensive Commercial Grain
Cultivation: Commercial grain cultivation
is practiced in the interior parts of semi-
arid lands of the midlatitudes. Wheat is the
principal crop though other crops like corn
barley oats and rye are also grown. This
type of agriculture is best developed
in Eurasian steppes the Canadian
and American Prairies the Pampas
of Argentina the Velds of South
Africa the Australian Downs and the
Canterbury Plains of New Zealand.

Mixed Farming: This form of agriculture
is found in the highly developed parts of
the world e.g. North-western Europe
Eastern North America parts of Eurasia
and the temperate latitudes of Southern
continents

Dairy Farming: There are three main
regions of commercial dairy farming.
The largest is North Western Europe
the second is in Canada and the third
belt includes South Eastern Australia
New Zealand and Tasmania.

Viticulture: Viticultureor grapecultivation
is a specialty of the Mediterranean
region. Best quality wines in the world
with distinctive flavors are produced from
high-quality grapes in various countries of
this region. The inferior grapes are dried
into raisins and currants. This region also
produces olives and figs.

Market Gardening and _ Horticulture:
Market gardening and _ horticulture
specialize in the cultivation of high-value
crops such as vegetables fruits and flowers
solely for the urban markets. This type of
agriculture is well developed in densely
populated industrial districts of north-
west Europe northeastern United States
of America and the Mediterranean regions.
The Netherlands specializes in growing
flowers and horticultural crops especially
tulips which are flown to all major cities
of Europe.

Co-operative Farming: In this type a group
of farmers form a co-operative society by
pooling in their resources voluntarily for


more efficient and profitable farming.
Co-operative movement originated over
a century ago and has been successful in
many western European countries like
Denmark Netherlands Belgium Sweden
Italy etc. In Denmark the movement has
been so successful that practically every
farmer is a member of a co-operative.

e Collective Farming: The basic principle
behind these types of farming is based on
social ownership of the means of production
and collective labor. Collective farming or
the model of Kolkhoz was introduced in the
erstwhile Soviet Union

For Question 291.---------------
Explanation:

Thorium and Uranium

Thorium is more abundant in nature
than uranium.

It is fertile rather than fissile and can
only be used as a fuel in conjunction
with a fissile material such as recycled
plutonium.

Thorium fuels can breed fissile uranium-
233 to be used in various kinds of nuclear
reactors.

Uranium can be used directly in reactors
whereas Thorium would go through a
three-stage process only then it can be put
into reactor assembly.

Uranium-fuelled reactors can be
built right away but they use fuel
inefficiently. Thorium-fuelled reactors
on the other hand are fuel-efficient almost
perfectly.

India has one of the world’s largest thorium
reserves.

For Question 292.---------------
Explanation:

Nuclear Power plants in India

Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant is
located in the Tamil Nadu Southern India.
It is the highest-capacity nuclear plant in
India with a total of 2000MW currently
installed with a further 2000MW under
construction.

The Tarapur Nuclear Reactor in
Maharashtra Western India is the oldest
nuclear facility in India having commenced
commercial operations in 196

The reactor is currently the second most
powerful in India with two BHWR of
160MW and two PHWR reactors of 540MW
forming a total of 1400MW.

Kalapakkam Nuclear Power Plant in
Tamil Nadu first began operating in 1984
and currently has two 235MW reactors
with two more reactors of 500MW and
600MW to be added at a later date.

Kalapakkam has a prototype fast breeder
reactor (PFBR) which does not produce
highly radioactive nuclear waste and can
produce 70% more energy.

The reactor survived the Vardah cyclone
when winds of up to 90mph hit Tamil Nadu
province in December 201


The Kakarapar Atomic Power Plant
in Gujarat Western India has two PHWR
reactors with a total installed capacity of
440MW. The two reactors were completed
in May 1993 and September 1995
respectively.

The plant was shut down for 66 days in
1998 due to a leak in its water systems but
it recovered to be awarded the best PHWR
in its class by the CANDU owners group in
January 2003

The plant also received a successful ‘heart
transplant’ in September 2018 when all of
its coolant channel and feeder tubes at the
core of its reactor were replaced.

For Question 293.---------------
Explanation:

Uranium and Nuclear

Global uranium production increased by
40% between 2004 and 2013 mainly because
of increased production by Kazakhstan the
world’s leading producer.

As of December 2015 65 nuclear reactors
were under construction with a total
capacity of 64 GW.

Two-thirds (44) of the units under
construction are located in three countries:
China India and Russia.

Currently there are more than 45
Small Modular Reactors designs under

1 Correct Option: (b)

For Question 294.---------------
Explanation:
Shale Gas

Shale gas refers to natural gas that is
trapped within shale formations. Shales
are fine-grained sedimentary rocks
that can be rich sources of petroleum
and natural gas.

Over the past decade the combination of
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing
has allowed access to large volumes of shale
gas that were previously uneconomical
to produce. The production of natural gas
from shale formations has rejuvenated the
natural gas industry in the United States.

Of the natural gas consumed in the
United States in 2009 87% was produced
domestically; thus the supply ofnatural gas
is not as dependent on foreign producers as


is the supply of crude oil and the delivery
system is less subject to interruption.
The availability of large quantities of
shale gas will further allow the United
States to consume a predominantly
domestic supply of gas.

e According to the EIA Annual Energy
Outlook 2011 the United States possesses
2552 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of potential
natural gas resources. Natural gas from
shale resources considered uneconomical
just a few years ago accounts for 827 Tcf
of this resource estimate more than double
the estimate published last year.

e At the 2009 rate of U.S. consumption
(about 28 Tcf per year) 2552 Tcf
of natural gas is enough to supply
approximately 110 years of use. Shale
gas resource and production estimates
increased significantly between the 2010
and 2011 Outlook reports and are likely to
increase further in the future.

e Natural gas is cleaner-burning than coal
or oil. The combustion of natural gas emits
significantly lower levels of key pollutants
including carbon dioxide (CO2) nitrogen
oxides and sulfur dioxide than does the
combustion of coal or oil.

e However there are some _ potential
environmental issues that are also
associated with the production of shale gas.
Shale gas drilling has significant water
supply issues. The drilling and fracturing
of wells requires large amounts of water. In
some areas of the country significant use of
water for shale gas production may affect
the availability of water for other uses and
can affect aquatic habitats.

For Question 296.---------------
Explanation:

Cotton Production in China

China is the world’s largest cotton producer
consumer and importer and Xinjiang
is China’s largest cotton producing
area.

The cotton production in Xinjiang is directly
related to the income level of local farmers
and also plays an important role in the
development of the whole cotton industry.

Xinjiang is situated in an arid region
and all agriculture in Xinjiang depends
on irrigation. With the development of
urbanization in Xinjiang water resources
have become polluted.

Meanwhile as a result of climate change
and the decrease in the availability of the
fresh water in Xinjiang the shortage of
water for agriculture becomes increasingly
serious. Thus there is a continuing need for
agriculture to reduce its water use rate.

A mulched drip irrigation technique
has been proven a great success.

Since 2000 the cotton planting area in
Xinjiang has shown a fluctuating and
increasing trend. Encouraged by the
increase of cotton price and government
subsidies the cotton planting area
increased significantly after 2017 and
the cotton planting area almost reached a
maximum.

The total cotton planting area in
Xinjiang will be 2x106ha in 202 In
2020 the estimated maximum amount
of water available for agriculture will be
95x1010m3and the available water per
unit area for cotton will be approximately
3860 m3/ha.

Bharat Biotech Launches New Rotavirus
Vaccine to Tackle Diarrhoea

Rotovac 5D has been developed with close
coordination with the Department of
Biotechnology.

Earlier Bharat Biotech had originated
ROTAVAC and now they have upgraded
their already available oral vaccine to
ROTAVAC 5D.
The roll-out of oral rotavirus vaccine is also
the lowest dose-volume rotavirus vaccine
in the world.

Along with the reduction in dosage they
have also made the oral vaccine low cold
chain proof. This has resulted in making
the vaccine stable at 2-degree to 8-degree
Celsius for up to 24 months.

Globally rotavirus causes approximately
200000 deaths and about 2 million
hospitalizations annually mostly in low-
income countries.

Currently ROTAVAC SD is being supplied
in seven countries including India and 50
more countries have registered for it.

What is rotavirus?

Rotavirus is a virus that infects the
bowels causing a severe inflammation
of the stomach and bowels (known as
gastroenteritis). It is a very contagious
virus that causes diarrhea.

Rotavirus is the most common cause of

COP 25 will take place from 2-13 December
in Madrid Spain.

Supplementary notes

Climate Emergency CoP 25: Climatic
tipping point is closer than we think

The 2019 United Nations Climate Change
Conference also known as COP285 is the
25th United Nations Climate Change
conference.

It was held in Madrid Spain under the
presidency of the Chilean government.

The conference incorporates the 25th
Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) the 15th meeting of
the parties for the Kyoto Protocol (CMP15)
and the second meeting of the parties for
the Paris Agreement.

Why climate emergency?

In the climate lexicon tipping points are
thresholdsbeyond whichcertainimpactscan


no longer be avoided even if temperatures
are brought down later. Examples include
the loss of the Amazon rainforest or of the
West Antarctic ice sheet.

Recent IPCC reports including last
year’s Global Warming of 5°C and this
year’s Special Report on the Ocean and
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate suggest
that tipping points could be exceeded even
between 1 and 2°C of warming.

This is worrying as we are on track to a 2
degree warmer world suggests the UNEP’s
Emissions Gap Report.

The report addresses biosphere tipping
points such as Amazonian deforestation
which can trigger abrupt carbon releases
into the atmosphere amplify climate
change and reduce remaining emission
budgets.

B C and D are incorrect:

Constitutional (101% Amendment) Act is
about GST.

Constitutional (107 Amendment) Act
provides constitutional status to the
National Commission for Backward Classes

(NCBC).

Constitutional (104% Amendment) Act
provides reservation to socially and
educationally backward sections

Supplementary Notes

William Hunter and Jyotirao Phule in
1882 originally conceived the idea of caste-
based reservation system.

RERREEREREE


The reservation system that exists today
in its true sense was introduced in 1933
when British Prime-Minister Ramsay
Macdonald presented the ‘Communal
Award’

The award made provision for separate
electorates for Muslims Sikhs Indian
Christians Anglo-Indians Europeans and
the Dalits.

After long negotiations Gandhi and
Ambedkar signed the ‘Poona Pact’ where
it was decided that there would be a single
Hindu electorate with certain reservations
in it.

After independence initially reservations
were provided only for SCs and STs.

OBCs were included in the ambit of
reservationin 1991 ontherecommendations
of the Mandal Commission.

In the Indra Sawhney Case of 1992 the
Supreme Court while upholding the 27
percent quota for backward classes
struck down the government notification
reserving 10% government jobs for
economically backward classes among the
higher castes.

Supreme Court in the same case also
upheld the principle that the combined
reservation beneficiaries should not exceed
50 percent of India’s population.

The concept of ‘creamy layer’ also gained
currency through this judgment and
provision that reservation for backward
classes should be confined to initial
appointments only and not extend to
promotions.

Recently the Constitutional
(103% Amendment) Act of 2019 has
provided 10% reservation in government
jobs and educational institutions for the
“economically backward” in the unreserved
category.

The Act amends Articles 15 and 16 of the
Constitution by adding clauses empowering
the government to provide reservation on
the basis of economic backwardness.

This 10% economic reservation is over and
above the 50% reservation cap.

Central & State Governments and is widely
used by National & International agencies
scholars business people industrialists
and many more.

According to the provisional population
count released within four weeks of
completing the Census India’s total
population in 2011 was 21 billion up
from 03 billion in 2001 thus adding 181
million people in one decade.

However the 2001-2011 decadal growth
rates of 16 % compared to 25
recorded during 1991-2001 suggests
slowing down of growth. Interestingly the
enumerated population size was larger
than most projections including that of the
Registrar General’s office that projected
the 2011 population to be 19 billion.

India is now expected to become the most
populous country of the world by 2030
overtaking China sooner than earlier
expected.

The State of Uttar Pradesh with 196
million people is India’s most populous
state accounting for 15% of country’s
population.

Supplementary Notes

The Industrial Relations Code 2019
seeks to replace three labour laws: (i) the
Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (ii) the Trade
Unions Act 1926 and (iii) the Industrial
Employment (Standing Orders) Act 194

Seeks to allow companies to hire workers
on fixed-term contract of any duration.

Has retained the threshold on the worker
count at 100 for prior government approval
before retrenchment but it has a provision
for changing ‘such number of employees’
through notification.

Provides setting up of a two-member
tribunal (in place of one member) wherein
important cases will be adjudicated jointly
and the rest by a single member resulting
speedier disposal of cases.

Has vested powers with the government
officers for adjudication of disputes
involving penalty as fines.

Introduces a feature of ‘recognition
of negotiating union’ under which a
trade union will be recognized as sole
‘negotiating union’ if it has the support of
75% or more of the workers on the rolls of
an establishment.

As several trade unions are active in
companies it will be tough for any one
group to manage 75% support hence
taking away their negotiating rights. In
such a case a negotiating council will be
constituted for negotiation.

Underlines that fixed-term employees will
get all statutory benefits on a par with the
regular employees who are doing work of
the same or similar nature.

Under the code termination of service of a
worker on completion of tenure in a fixed-
term employment will not be considered as
retrenchment.

Proposes setting up of a “re-skilling
fund” for training of retrenched employees.
The retrenched employee would be paid 15
days’ wages from the fund within 45 days
of retrenchment.

Hawaii Islands are not Island arcs but
are formed by a linear chain of volcanoes.
These Islands are formed by the outpouring
of highly basaltic mobile lava which comes
out of the submarine volcanoes cool down
and consolidate over time.

These submarine volcanoes were the
hotspot volcanoes or plum volcanoes over
which the pacific plate passed which led
to the deposition of basaltic lava on it and
Islands were formed.

For Question 334.---------------
Explanation:

Coal reserves in India

Most of the world’s coal was formed in
Carboniferous age (350 million years ago).
It is the best quality of coal reserves but
India does not have this type of coalfields.

Gondwana Coalfields were formed nearly
250 million years ago. They make up to 98
percent of the total reserves and 99 percent
of the production of coal in India.

Tertiary coal is 15 to 60 million years
old hence its carbon content is very low.
Mainly confined to the extra-Peninsula the
important areas of Tertiary coal include
parts of Assam Meghalaya Arunachal
Pradesh Nagaland Himalayan foothills
of Darjeeling in West Bengal Jammu
and Kashmir Uttar Pradesh Rajasthan
Kerala Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

On the basis of carbon content Coal
is of 4 types viz. Anthracite(80-95% C)
Bituminous (60-80% c) Lignite (40-55%
c)and Peat (less than 40% C). Anthracite
coal is very rare in India. Only Jammu
& Kashmir has this type of coal
reserves.

On the basis of metallurgical uses Coal is of
two types viz. Coking coal and non-Coking


coal. Jharkhand produces more than 90%
of India’s Coking coal. Girdih coalfield of
Jharkhand produces the coking coal.

complete on rotation. Days and nights
occur due to rotation of the Earth.

e Thesecond motion of the earth around the
gun in its orbit is called revolution. It takes
365% days (one year) to revolve around the
sun.

e Six hours saved every year are added to
make one day (24 hours) over a span of
four years. This surplus day is added to the
month of February.


e Thus every fourth year February is of 29
days instead of 28 days. Such a year with

For Question 341.---------------
Explanation:

Geomorphic Forces

Our earth is a play field of two opposing
forces. The Endogenetic forces make
the surface uneven while Exogenetic
forces (flowing water winds glaciers
etc.) destroy the raised portions and
try to level them down.

Due to the activities of these two forces the
cycle of life comes into being on the earth
or else the earth would have been a leveled
and lifeless planet.

The exogenetic forces through weathering
and erosion act to destroy the relief of the
earth’s surface.

The activity of wearing away the rocks
of the land surface of the earth by
external forces is called Denudation.

The word Denudation is derived from
a Latin word denudare which means to
lay bare. It therefore includes the three
processes.

soon.

About: Banihal Qazigund Road Tunnel
is an 5 km road tunnel at an elevation
of 1790 m in the Pir Panjal range in the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
connecting Banihal and Qazigund.

It is a double tube tunnel consisting of two
parallel tunnels - one for each direction of
travel. Each tunnel is 7 m wide and has
two lanes of road.

The two tunnels are interconnected by a
passage at every 500 m for maintenance
and emergency evacuation.

The tunnel will have forced ventilation
for extracting smoke and stale air and
infusing fresh air. It will have state of the
art monitoring and control systems for
security.


Signifi cance: It will replace existing
dependence on Jawahar Tunnel which is
prone to avalanches and is closed time to
time.

The new  Banihal-Qazigund tunnel’s
elevation is 1790 metres (5870 feet) 400
metres below the Jawahar tunnel. This
makes it less prone to avalanches.

defeated the massive Peshwa army led by
Peshwa Bajirao II in Koregaon.

Supplementary notes

202nd Anniversary of Battle of Koregaon
Bhima

Bhima-Koregaon a small village in Pune
district of Maharashtra has a rich Maratha
history. Two hundred years ago on January
1 1818 a few hundred Mahar soldiers of
the East India Company led by the British
defeated the massive Peshwa army led by
Peshwa Bajirao II in Koregaon.

Legend has it that about 500 Mahar
soldiers under the East India Company
clashed with a 25000-strong army of
Peshwa Bajirao II.

Mahars at this point were considered
an untouchable community and were not
recruited in the army by the peshwas.

This battle has since attained legendary
stature in Dalit history.

The Dalits who follow BR Ambedkar view
this battle as a victory of Mahars over the
injustice and torture meted out to them by
the Brahminical Peshwas.

Supplementary Notes

Recently United Nations approved a
Russian-led resolution that aims to create
a new convention on cybercrime when
Budapest Convention is already there.
India has voted in its favour. Russia
has opposed the Budapest Convention
arguing that giving investigators access
to computer data across borders violates
national sovereignty.
The Council of Europe’s (CoE)
Cybercrime Convention is also known
as the Budapest Convention. It was
open for signature in 2001 and came into
force in 200

The convention is the sole legally
binding international multilateral
treaty on cybercrime. It coordinates
cybercrime investigations between nation-
states and criminalizes certain cybercrime
conduct.

It serves as a guideline for any country
developing comprehensive national
legislation against Cybercrime and as
a framework for international cooperation
between state parties to this treaty.

The Budapest Convention is supplemented
by a Protocol on Xenophobia and
Racism committed through computer
systems.

that agreements still remained one of the
successful climate treaties. Therefore US
exit has not demotivated the countries but

nations for exerting more pressure for
strict climate agreements

Supplementary Notes

Recently 25th Conference of Parties (CoP
25) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change concluded
in December 2019 at Madrid.

Background

Why CoP 25 is a failure?

The key deliverables from the 25th
Conference of Parties (CoP 25) to the
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Madrid
(originally scheduled in Santiago Chile)
were two-fold:

Rules under Article 6 of the Paris
Agreement which deals with carbon
trading or carbon markets

The creation of a financial mechanism
dedicated to loss and damage


With some caveats CoP 25 failed to deliver
on these requirements. Reasons for this
are:

No Consensus on Rules on carbon market

>» There was no consensus on rules
under Article 

>» The European Union (EU) and
Switzerland held that the lack of
consensus on rules would not prevent
the operation of carbon markets.

» They are both relying on Article 2
of the Paris Agreement which deals
with bilateral and mini-multilateral
markets.

>» This is in contrast with Article
4 which creates a_ centralised
global market — the Sustainable
Development Mechanism which
effectively succeeds the Clean
Development Mechanism under the
Kyoto Protocol. It is clear that the
Article 4 market cannot operate
without consensus on rules.

» Article 2 is a little different. It does
not create a market. It regulates
bilateral and mini-multilateral
markets and it does so indirectly. It
sets up conditions under which credits
from these markets can be used to
achieve a country’s national targets
(nationally determined contributions
or NDCs).

> (nationally determined contributions
or NDCs).

Lack of Clarity on Loss and Damage

>» Loss and damage refers to the
unavoidable irreversible impacts of
climate change where mitigation has
failed and adaptation is not possible.

>» It is important to distinguish it from
adaptation particularly because
while some ‘new and additional’
finance was committed to adaptation
in the Paris Decision loss and damage
has not been similarly addressed yet.

>» Financial support is one of the work-
streamsoftheWarsaw International
Mechanism on Loss and Damage
(WIM) which was set up in 201
Work on this front has remained
stagnant for six years and vulnerable
countries and activists were clear that
COP 25 needed to establish secure
new and additional finance for loss

sper


» The debate coming into this CoP was
initially centered on whether this
finance would take the form of:

e A finance arm of the WIM —
opposed by developed countries
because they consider it an
admission of liability for climate
change

e A financing ‘window’ under the
Green Climate Fund (GCF) —
opposed by developing countries
because it would risk diluting
the distinction between loss and
damage and adaptation and
effectively reducing the amount of
finance available for both

India’s mixed role in CoP 25

>» India played a mixed role at the
recently concluded 25th Conference of
Parties (CoP 25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate
Change at Madrid.

>» Union Minister of Environment
Forest and Climate Change Prakash
Javadekar emphasized the transition
of the Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM) credits earned under the Kyoto
Protocol to the Paris Agreement. He
effectively demanded the carryover
of the untraded emission reduction
certificates held by Indian companies
(estimated at 750 million Certified
Emissions Reductions or CERs) which
they can sell to raise funds.

>» On the question of ‘loss and damage’
the minister urged developed countries
to give financial teeth to the Warsaw
International Mechanism on Loss
and Damage (WIM). The Warsaw
Mechanism has been resisted by
these countries due to their paranoia
(officially enshrined) that the provision
of finance would imply admission of
legal liability.

» India played a strong role in critiquing
the developed world’s continuing poor
record on climate action.

» India also took a lead in calling for
more finance for developing countries
for climate action with the minister
emphasizing that “not even 2 per cent”
of the promised “$1 trillion in the last
10 years” had been delivered.

 Correct Option: (c)

For Question 346.---------------
Explanation:

Orbit and Rotation of the Sun

The Sun and everything that orbits it
is located in the Milky Way galaxy. More
specifically our Sun is in a spiral arm called
the Orion Spur that extends outward from
the Sagittarius arm. From there the Sun
orbits the center of the Milky Way Galaxy
bringing the planets asteroids comets and
other objects along with it.

The Sun rotates as it orbits the center
of the Milky Way. Its spin has an axial tilt
of 25 degrees with respect to the plane of
the planets’ orbits. Since the Sun is not
a solid body different parts of the Sun
rotate at different rates. At the equator
the Sun spins around once about every 25
days but at its poles the Sun rotates once
on its axis every 36 Earth days.

 Correct Option: (d)

For Question 347.---------------
Explanation:

Structure of the Sun

The Sun like other stars is a ball of gas.
In terms of the number of atoms it is made
of 90% hydrogen and 9% helium. By
mass the Sun is about 76% hydrogen
and 24% helium.

The Sun has six regions: the core the
radiative zone and the convective zone
in the interior; the visible surface called
the photosphere; the chromosphere;
and the outermost region the corona.

At the core the temperature is about 27
million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million
degrees Celsius) which is sufficient to
sustain thermonuclear fusion.

Energy from the core is carried outward
by radiation which bounces around the
radiative zone taking about 170000
years to get from the core to the top of the
convective zone.


The surface of the Sun the photosphere
is a 300-mile-thick (500-kilometer-thick)
region from which most of the Sun’s
radiation escapes outward. This is not a
solid surface like the surfaces of planets.
Instead this is the outer layer of the gassy
star. We see radiation from the photosphere
as sunlight when it reaches Earth about
eight minutes after it leaves the Sun. The
temperature of the photosphere is about
10000 degrees Fahrenheit (5500 degrees
Celsius).

Above the photosphere lie the tenuous
chromosphere and _ the _ corona
(crown) which make up the thin solar
atmosphere. This is where we see
features such as sunspots and solar
flares. Strangely the temperature in
the Sun’s atmosphere increases with
altitude reaching as high as 5 million
degrees Fahrenheit (2 million degrees
Celsius). The source of coronal heating
has been a scientific mystery for more
than 50 years.

The Sun releases a constant stream of
particles and magnetic fields called the
solar wind. This solar wind slams worlds
across the solar system with particles and
radiation — which can stream all the way
to planetary surfaces unless thwarted by
an atmosphere magnetic field or both.

The Sun does not have rings.

The Sun and other stars don’t have moons;
instead they have planets and their moons
along with asteroids comets and other
objects.

Magnetosphere of the Sun

The electric currents in the Sun generate
a complex magnetic field that extends
out into space to form the interplanetary
magnetic field. The volume of space
controlled by the Sun’s magnetic field is
called the heliosphere.
The Sun’s magnetic field is carried out
through the solar system by the solar
wind—a stream of electrically charged
gas blowing outward from the Sun in
all directions. Since the Sun rotates the
magnetic field spins out into a large rotating
spiral known as the Parker spiral.

The Sun doesn’t behave the same way
all the time. It goes through phases of its
own solar cycle. Approximately every
11 years the Sun’s geographic poles
change their magnetic polarity. When
this happens the Sun’s_ photosphere
chromosphere and corona undergo changes
from quiet and calm to violently active.
The height of the Sun’s activity known as
solar maximum is a time of solar storms:
sunspots solar flares and coronal mass
ejections. These are caused by irregularities
in the Sun’s magnetic field and can release
huge amounts of energy and particles some
of which reach us here on Earth. This space
weather can damage satellites corrode
pipelines and affect power grids.

For Question 348.---------------
Explanation:

Aurora

When a solar storm(coronal mass ejection)
comes toward us some of the energy
and small particles can travel down the
magnetic field lines at the north and south
poles into Earth’s atmosphere. There the
particles interact with gaseous ions in our
atmosphere resulting in beautiful displays
of light in the sky. Oxygen gives off green
and red light. Nitrogen glows blue and
purple. This is called Aurora.

Aurora (the Southern and Northern
Lights) primarily occur in_ the
thermosphere due to presence of
Charge particles over there.


It mainly occurs near the poles as the
magnetic field intensity of the Earth at
the poles are strong. it is called an aurora
borealis or northern lights if it occurs at
the North Pole. If occurred at the South
Pole it is called an aurora australis or the
southern lights.

If other planets have atmosphere and
magnetic field for instance Jupiter and
Saturn they too can have aurorae.

For Question 349.---------------
Explanation:
Van Allen belt

    
   

A magnetosphere is that area of space
around a planet that is controlled by
the planet’s magnetic field. The shape of
the Earth’s magnetosphere is the direct
result of being blasted by solar wind. The
solar wind compresses its sunward side
to a distance of only 6 to 10 times the
radius of the Earth. A supersonic shock
wave is created sunward of Earth called
the Bow Shock. Most of the solar wind
particles are heated and slowed at the
bow shock and detour around the Earth
in the Magnetosheath. The solar wind
drags out the night-side magnetosphere
to possibly 1000 times Earth’s radius; its
exact length is not known. This extension
of the magnetosphere is known as the
Magnetotail. The outer boundary of
Earth’s confined geomagnetic field is
called the Magnetopause. The Earth’s
magnetosphere is a highly dynamic
structure that responds dramatically to
solar variations. The magnetosheath is the
region of space between the magnetopause
and the bow shock of a _ planet's
magnetosphere.

The Van Allen Belts are a region of
charged particles held in place by the
magnetosphere. Named for their discoverer
James Van Allen the belts swell and
shrink over time. The belts swell when
already energetic electrons and protons are
