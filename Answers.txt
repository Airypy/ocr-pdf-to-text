For Question 1.---------------
 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Universe
Claudius Ptolemy was the first to put
forward the geocentric view of the
Universe. He postulated that the Earth
is in the center of the universe and all the
celestial bodies are moving around it.
Nicolaus Copernicus shattered the long-
held notion that the Earth was the center of
the solar system proposing a heliocentric
(sun-centered) model instead.
In the early 1920s Edwin Hubble detected
Cepheid variables in the nearby Andromeda
galaxy and discerned that it was just under
a million light-years away. He also said
that the diameter of the universe is
5 billion light-years. Today the best
estimate is that the galaxy is actually 54
million light-years away.
For Question 2.---------------
 Correct Option: (b)
Explanation:
Earth
Our solar system consists of our star the
Sun and everything bound to it by gravity
- the planets Mercury Venus Earth Mars
Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune
dwarf planets such as Pluto dozens of
moons and millions of asteroids comets
and meteoroids.
The inner rocky planets are Mercury
Venus Earth and Mars. These are also
called the terrestrial planets. The Earth
is the largest terrestrial planet.
The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter
and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and
Neptune. Jupiter is the largest gas giant.
An astronomical unit (AU) is the average
from Earth to the Sun about 93 million
miles (150 million km). Thus the earth is
exactly one AU away from the sun.
Earth’s mean obliquity is currently
23°26'11" (or 243668°).
For Question 3.---------------
Correct Option: (c)
Explanation:
Theories of Origin of Life
Six major theories are proposed to explain
the origin of life on earth. These theories
are as follows:
>» Theory of Special Creations: It
proposes that life on earth is created
by a supernatural power the GOD.
It also proposes that all the living
organisms in present form were
created the same day.
» Theory of spontaneous generations: It
assumes that non-living material in a
spontaneous manner gives rise to life.
This theory was criticized by Lazzaro
Spallanzani Francisco Redi and Louis
Pasteur.
» Theory of catastrophism: It assumes
that life is originated by the special
creation and it is followed by
catastrophe due to geographical
disturbances.
» Theory of cosmozoic: This theory was
put forward by Richter and strongly
supported by Arrhenius. The theory
assumes that life was present in the
form of resistant spores and appeared
on earth from other planets. Since the
condition of earth was supporting the
life these spores grew and evolved into
different organisms. This theory was
also known as “theory of panspermia
or spore theory”.
» The modern theory/ Chemical Theory/
Theory of primary abiogenesis: In
the modern theory the hypothesis
of abiogenesis was proposed with a
condition that the non-living materials
can give rise to life in the condition
of primitive earth. The condition of
the primitive earth is different from
the present conditions which do not
permit abiogenesis. The idea of
chemical theory was put forward
by two scientists A.I. Oparin and
J.B.S Haldane.
It has made the following assumptions:
» Spontaneous generation of life under
the present environment is not
possible.
» Earth’s atmosphere ~1 billion years
is very different from the current
conditions.
>» Primitive earth’s atmosphere was
reducing in nature.
>» Under these conditions the chemical
molecules (inorganic molecules) react
with each
>» other through a series of reactions to
form organic substances and other
complex
> biomolecules.
>» The solar energy and UV radiation
provided the energy for the chemical
reactions.
The hypothesis proposed by Haldane
didn’t find much support without scientific
experimentation. To conclusively support
the chemical theory Miller and Urey
conducted a successful experiment in
mimicking primitive earth environment.
As per the hypothesis the origin of life
have four major steps:
>» Formation of Inorganic molecules
>» Spontaneous formation of monomeric
organic compounds
>» Spontaneous formation of complex
organic compounds
» Spontaneous formation of molecular
aggregates
After this the first protocells and first cell
were formed.
For Question 4.---------------
Correct Option: (d)
Explanation:
Parts of Earth
The Earth consists of three parts as
follows:
>» Baryosphere: it is the central core
of the earth. It is filled with molten
magma with a large quantity of
iron and nickel. Baryosphere has
two zones: the inner core region
(~800 miles radius) and the outer
core region (~1400miles radius).
» Pyrosphere: it is the middle part of
the earth also known as mantle. It is
~1800 miles in thickness and mainly
consists of silica manganese and
magnesium.
» Lithosphere: it is the outermost region
of the earth also known as crust. It is
20-25 miles in thickness and mainly
has silica and aluminum.
For Question 5.---------------
 Correct Option: (d)
Explanation:
Kuiper belt
It is a donut-shaped region of icy
bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.
There may be millions of these icy objects
collectively referred to as Kuiper Belt
objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects
(TNOs) in this distant region of our solar
system.
Similar to the asteroid belt the Kuiper
Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar
system’s early history. Like the asteroid
belt it has also been shaped by a giant
planet although it’s more of a thick disk
dike a donut) than a thin belt.
For Question 6.---------------
 Correct Option: (d)
Explanation:
Latitude and longitude
Thetime difference is due to the longitudinal
difference. 1 Degree = 4 minutes i.e. 15
degrees= 1 hour.
There is a difference of 120 degrees
(between 60°E and 60°W) in the longitudes
between the two places i.e. 8 hours.
Now at 60°E there is a gain of 8
hours as East is earlier to the West
(geographically).
For Question 7.---------------
 Correct Option: (c)
Explanation:
Tim zones
A time zone is a region or area that
observes the same standard time. The
world is divided longitudinally into time
zones with each hour difference roughly
15 degrees apart.
Most countries having smaller longitudinal
expanse have only one time-zone. There
are 23 countries with at least two time
zones.
The top 10 countries having the most
number of time zones are France(12)
United States(11) Russia(11) United
Kingdom(9) Australia(8) Canada(6)
Denmark(5) New Zealand (5) Brazil(4)
and Mexico(4).
Despite France and UK are small
countries they have more time zones
as they have a number of overseas
territories esp. in all three Oceans.
China despite being the third-largest
country has only one time-zone due to
its political ideology.
For Question 8.---------------
 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Asteroids Comets and Meteors
Asteroids sometimes called minor planets
are rocky airless remnants left over from
the early formation of our solar system
about 6 billion years ago. Most of this
ancient space rubble can be found orbiting
the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within
the main asteroid belt.
Meteoroids are objects in space that range
in size from dust grains to small asteroids.
Think of them as “space rocks.” When
meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere
(or that of another planet like Mars) at
high speed and burn up the fireballs or
“shooting stars” are called meteors. When
a meteoroid survives a trip through
the atmosphere and hits the ground
it’s called a meteorite.
Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen
gases rock and dust that orbit the Sun.
When frozen they are the size of a small
town. When a comet’s orbit brings it close
to the Sun it heats up and spews dust and
gases into a giant glowing head larger than
most planets. The dust and gases form
a tail that stretches away from the Sun
for millions of miles. There are likely
billions of comets orbiting our Sun in
the Kuiper Belt and even more distant
Oort Cloud.
Comets and _ asteroids probably
delivered some of the water and other
ingredients that allowed the complex
chemistry of life to begin on Earth. The
amino acid glycine was discovered in
the comet dust returned to Earth by
the Stardust mission. Glycine is used
by living organisms to make proteins.
The discovery supports the theory
that some of life’s ingredients formed
in space and were delivered to Earth
long ago by meteorite and comet
impacts
The Oort Cloud is an extended shell
of icy objects that exist in the outermost
reaches of the solar system. It is named
after astronomer Jan Oort who first
theorized its existence.
For Question 9.---------------
 Correct Option: (c)
Explanation:
Solar System
Dark cold and whipped by supersonic
winds ice giant Neptune is the eighth and
most distant planet in our solar system.
More than 30 times as far from the Sun as
Earth Neptune is the only planet in our
solar system not visible to the naked
eye and the first predicted by mathematics
before its discovery.
When Earth was a young planet a large
chunk of rock smashed into it displacing
a portion of Earth’s interior. The resulting
chunks clumped together and formed
our Moon. With a radius of 1080 miles
(1738 kilometers) the Moon is the fifth
largest moon in our solar system (after
Ganymede Titan Callisto and Io).
Earth is the only planet which has a
single moon (so far). Other planets have
either zero or multiple moons.
However the scientists have claimed
that Earth has two extra ‘moons’ — made
entirely of dust and nine times wider than
our planet. After more than half a century
of speculation and controversy Hungarian
astronomers and _ physicists finally
confirmed the existence of these moons.
For Question 10.---------------
1 Correct Option: (b)
Explanation:
Famous Astronomers
Galileo experimented with and refined
telescopes. He is perhaps best known
for discovering the four most massive
moons of Jupiter now known as the
Galilean moons.
Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens
proposed that a thin flat ring circled
Saturn. He also discovered the first
moon of Saturn Titan. He made the first
known drawing of the Orion Nebula.
In 1672 Cassini and colleague Jean
Richer used the parallax method to
determine the distance of Mars from
Earth permitting the first estimations of
the dimensions of the solar system. Using
a method outlined by Galileo Cassini
was also the first to make successful
measurements of longitude. Cassini made
the first observations of four of Saturn’s
moons: Iapetus Rhea Tethys and Dione.
In addition he discovered the Cassini
Division in the rings of Saturn in 167
Charles Messier (1730-1817) of France
developed an interest in astronomy
at an early age having witnessed a
6-tailed comet at age 14 in 1744
For Question 11.---------------
1 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Great Red Spot
The Great Red Spot is a persistent
anticyclonic storm on the planet
Jupiter 22 degrees south of the
equator.
With tumultuous winds peaking at about
400 mph the Great Red Spot has been
swirling wildly over Jupiter’s skies for the
past 150 years or maybe even much longer
than that.
The storm is large enough to be visible
through Earth-based telescopes.
It was probably first observed by Cassini
who described it around 166
It is large enough to contain two or three
planets of Earth-size.
For Question 12.---------------
1 Correct Option: (d)
Explanation:
Evidence of the Earth’s Sphericity
There are many ways to prove that the
earth is spherical. The following are some
of them.
>» Circum-navigation of the earth
>» The circular horizon
» Ship’s visibility over the distant
horizon
» The sun rises and sets at different
times in different places
» The shadow cast by the earth on
the moon during the lunar eclipse
is always circular
» Planetary bodies are spherical
» Driving poles on level ground on a
curved earth
» Aerial photographs etc.
For Question 13.---------------
1 Correct Option: (d)
Explanation:
Standard Meridian of India
The standard meridian of India is 85
degrees east of the Greenwich Meridian.
In 1905 this longitude was selected as the
meridian to create the Indian Standard
It passes through Uttar Pradesh Madhya
Pradesh Chattisgarh Odisha and Andhra
Pradesh.
For Question 14.---------------
1 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Apparent movements of the Sun
In the course of the year the earth‘s
revolution around the sun with its axis
inclined at 65 degrees to the plane of the
ecliptic changes the apparent altitude of
the midday sun.
The sun is vertically overhead at the
equator on two days each year. These
are usually 21 March and 21 September
though the date changes because of year is
not exactly 365 days. These two days are
termed equinoxes meaning ‘equal nights’
because on these two days all parts of
the world have equal days and nights.
After the March equinox the sun appears
to move north and is vertically overhead at
the Tropic of Cancer (25 degrees North)
on about 21 June. This is known as the
June or summer solstice when the northern
hemisphere will have its longest day and
night.
By about 22 December the sun is overhead
at the Tropic of Capricorn (25 degrees
South). This is the winter solstice when the
southern hemisphere will have its longest
day and shortest night.
The tropics thus mark the limits of the
overhead sun for beyond these the
sun is never overhead at any time of
the year.
For Question 15.---------------
1 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Dawn and Twilight
The brief period between sunrise and full
daylight is called dawn and that between
sunset and complete darkness is termed
2
This is caused by the fact that during
the periods of dawn and twilight the
earth receives diffused or refracted
light from the sun whilst it is still
below the horizon.
Since the sun rises and sets in a vertical
path at the equator the period during
which refracted light is received is
short.
But in temperate latitudes the sun
rises and sets in an oblique path and
the period of refracted light is longer.
It is much longer still at the poles so that
the winter darkness is really the only
twilight most of the time.
For Question 16.---------------
1 Correct Option: (c)
Explanation:
Oort Cloud
The Oort Cloud is an extended shell of icy
objects that exist in the outermost reaches
of the solar system. It is named after
astronomer Jan Oort who first theorised
its existence. The Oort Cloud is roughly
spherical and is thought to be the origin
of most of the long-period comets that have
been observed.
This cloud of particles is theorized to be
the remains of the disc of material that
formed the Sun and planets. Astronomers
now refer to those primeval objects as a
protoplanetary disk.
ad
BELT
 
The most likely theory is that the material
now in the Oort Cloud probably formed
closer to the young Sun in the earliest
epochs of solar system formation. As the
planets grew and in particular as Jupiter
coalesced and migrated to its present
position its gravitational influence is
thought to have scattered many icy objects
out to their present position in the Oort
cloud.
Objects in the Oort Cloud are also referred
to as Trans-Neptunian objects. This name
also applies to objects in the Kuiper Belt.
The Oort Cloud is very distant from the
Sun and it can be disrupted by the nearby
passage of a star nebula or by actions in
the disk of the Milky Way. Those actions
knock cometary nuclei out of their orbits
and send them on a headlong rush toward
the Sun.
For Question 17.---------------
1 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Latitudes:
The Equator is an imaginary line around
the middle of the Earth. It is halfway
between the North and South Poles and
divides the Earth into the Northern and
Southern Hemispheres.
The Earth is widest at its Equator. The
distance around the Earth at the Equator
its circumference is 40075 kilometers
(24901 miles).
Orbital plane is the plane formed by the
orbit. The axis of the Earth is an imaginary
line that makes an angle of 66%° with its
orbital plane.
Latitudes and Longitudes are imaginary
lines used to determine the location of a
place on earth. Parallels of Latitudes are
the angular distance of a point on the
earth’s surface measured in degrees from
the center of the Earth.
As the earth is slightly flattened at the
poles the linear distance of a degree of
latitude at the pole is a little longer than
that at the equator.
Besides the equator (0°) the north pole
(90°N) and the south pole (90°S) there are
four important parallels of latitudes—
>» Tropic of Cancer (23%° N) in the
Northern Hemisphere.
» Tropic of Capricorn (23%° S) in the
Southern Hemisphere.
» Arctic Circle at 66%° North of the
Equator.
» Antarctic Circle at 66%° South of the
Equator.
For Question 18.---------------
1 Correct Option: (b)
Explanation:
Direct Sources
The most easily available solid earth
material is surface rock or the rocks we get
from mining areas.
Volcanic eruption forms another source
of direct information. As and when the
molten material (magma) is thrown
onto the surface of the earth it becomes
available for laboratory analysis. However
it is difficult to ascertain the depth of the
source of such magma.
Direct sources include rock materials from
mining areas and molten magma from
volcanic eruptions.
Indirect Sources
Analysis of properties of matter provides
indirect information about the interior of
the Earth.
Another source of information is the
meteors that at times reach the earth.
Indirect sources include meteors that
at times reach the earth gravitation
magnetic field and seismic activity.
For Question 19.---------------
1 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Surface waves: These waves travel
through the surface of the earth. Due to
their amplitude they are most destructive
waves causing extensive damage on the
surface of the earth.
Types of Surface Waves:
>» Love waves (L-waves) - its fastest
surface waves and move on ground
side to side. It is confined to surface
of the crust love wave is wounded by
Seismograph.
>» Rayleigh waves- Rayleigh waves
rolls along the ground just like a wave
roll across a lake or an ocean.
Body waves: These waves travel through
the interiors of the earth. While travelling
through interiors their characteristics
such as velocity and wavelength changes
according to the density of the medium in
which they are travelling. The body waves
are recorded at different seismograph
stations located at different places
throughout the surface of earth. Body
waves can be further categorized into
>» Primary Waves: Also known as
P-waves. These are longitudinal or
compressive in nature. These waves
can pass through solid as well as liquid
medium. The velocity of these waves
increases with increasing density and
rigidity of the medium. (They travel
faster in solid than in liquids)
» Secondary waves: Also known as
S-waves. These are transverse or
distortional in nature. These waves
cannot pass through liquid medium.
Their velocity also increases with
increasing rigidity of the medium.
Nature of Body Waves:
» These waves (both P and S waves)
travel faster in rigid medium.
» Among P and S waves the velocity of P
waves is more.
>» These waves while passing from
one medium to another medium
of different density experiences
refraction (bending from original
path) similar to the light waves.
For Question 20.---------------
2 Correct Option: (d)
Explanation:
Conrad discontinuity: The Conrad
discontinuity corresponds to the sub-
horizontal boundary in continental crust at
which the seismic wave velocity increases
in a discontinuous way. This boundary is
observed in various continental regions
at a depth of 15 to 20 km between outer
and inner crust however it is not found in
oceanic regions.
Mohorovicic discontinuity: The
Mohorovicic Discontinuity or “Moho” is
the boundary between the crust and the
mantle.
Repetti discontinuity: This discontinuity
is found between upper and lower Mantle.
This is marked by general decrease in
velocity of seismic waves between upper
and lower mantle.
Gutenberg discontinuity: The
Gutenberg discontinuity occurs within
Earth’s interior at a depth of about 1800
mi (2900 km) below the surface generally
between mantle and core where there
is an abrupt change in the seismic waves
(generated by earthquakes or explosions)
that travel through Earth.
Lehmann discontinuity: The Lehmann
discontinuity is an abrupt increase of
P-wave and S-wave velocities at the depth of
220430 km discovered by seismologist Inge
Lehmann. It appears beneath continents
but not usually beneath oceans and does
not readily appear in globally averaged
studies. It is generally found between
outer and inner core.

For Question 22.---------------
2 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
e Option (a) is correct.
Supplementary notes:
Giraffe
e The giraffe has been placed in Appendix
II of CITES which places prohibitions
2
on uncontrolled trade in a_ species.
The Conference of Parties (CoP) to the
Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species or CITES in Geneva
passed a resolution to place the giraffe in
Appendix II of CITES.
Giraffes those tall stately and graceful
animals of Africa’s savannahs have been
accorded protection from unregulated trade
as the world finally woke up to their ‘silent
extinction’.
The Appendix II listing was proposed by
Central African Republic Chad Kenya
Mali Niger and Senegal.
“Appendix II includes species not
necessarily threatened with extinction but
in which trade must be controlled in order
to avoid utilization incompatible with their
survival”
Giraffes once ranged over much of the semi-
arid savannah and savannah woodlands of
Africa. But their numbers have plummeted
dramatically — by up to 40 per cent over
the last 30 years — due to threats including
international trade in their parts as well
as habitat loss civil unrest and illegal
hunting.
While giraffes fall prey to poaching for bush
meat bones skin and tail hair there is also
a significant amount of international trade
in their bone carvings and trophies.
There is currently only one recognized
species of giraffe with nine sub-species.
They have been listed as ‘vulnerable’ on
the International Union for Conservation
of Species Red List since 2016 with some
sub-species classified as ‘endangered” or
‘critically endangered’.
Five of the nine sub-species have only a
small wild population while four have
a decreasing population trend. All are
affected by trade.
While the Appendix II listing will not stop
all trade in giraffe parts it will ensure this
is not contributing to further population
declines and provide global scale data that
could not otherwise be obtained.

For Question 24.---------------
2 Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Option (a) is correct: Researchers develop
pesticide alternative to protect plants form
viral infection. The programme first triggers
plants’ cells to multiply the virus which
creates viral ribonucleic acid molecules
(RNAs). Using special enzyme scissors the
plants then detect these molecules and cut
them — a process which produces ‘small
interfering RNAs’ (siRNAs).
Supplementary notes:
Small interfering RNAs’ (siRNAs)
Anovel approach to vaccinate plants against
viruses can be used as an alternative to
toxic pesticides that is harmful both to
insects and the environment.
During a virus attack plants initiate a
two-stage molecular defense programme
which protects them “both at the site of the
infection and throughout its structure.
The programme first triggers plants’ cells
to multiply the virus which creates viral
ribonucleic acid molecules (RNAs). Using
special enzyme scissors the plants then
detect these molecules and cut them — a
process which produces ‘small interfering
RNAsg’ (siRNAs).
The siRNAs spreads throughout the
plant and attach them to a protein called
Argonaute. The siRNAs then leads the
protein to RNAs viruses to kill them.
After six weeks 90 per cent of the vaccinated
plants did not show any signs of infection
but all the untreated plants were killed by
the virus.

Explanation:
Option (d) is correct: Tamil Nadu
Becomes Fifth Indian State to Declare
a State Butterfly after Maharashtra
(Blue Mormon) Uttarakhand (Common
peacock) Karnataka (Southern birdwings)
and Kerala (Malabar banded peacock) to
bestow a state emblem status to one of its
colorful insects.
Supplementary notes:
Tamil Nadu Becomes Fifth Indian State to
Declare a State Butterfly.
Tamil Nadu has recently declared Tamil
Yeoman (Cirrochroa thais) as its state
butterfly to symbolize its rich natural
and cultural heritage in a move aimed
at boosting the conservation efforts of the
16
Locally known as Tamil Maravan meaning
‘Tamilian Warrior’ the canopy butterfly
belongs to the family of brush-footed
butterflies or the Nymphalid.
This is the latest addition to Tamil Nadu’s
existing symbols from the natural world —
palmyra as the state tree gloriosa lily as
the state flower emerald dove as the state
bird and jackfruit as the state fruit and
Nilgiri tahr as the state animal.
This butterfly species is endemic to Western
Ghats.
Once the species is declared as a state
butterfly this will help channelizing
government funds towards a particular
environmental cause.
Tamil Nadu has a total of 32 species of
butterflies endemic to the state.
It has become the fifth India state after
Maharashtra (Blue Mormon) Uttarakhand
(Common peacock) Karnataka (Southern
birdwings) and Kerala (Malabar banded
peacock) to bestow a state emblem status
to one of its colorful insects.
Both southern bird wings which is the
largest butterfly species found in India
and Malabar banded peacocks are like the
Tamil Yeoman endemic to the Western
Ghats as well.
