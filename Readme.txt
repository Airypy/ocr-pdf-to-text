Hello coders,

This is a mini-ocr project which extracts the text from the pdf data and outputs into separate files.

Details:
% It extracts questions and store it in Questions.txt similarly for answers and multiple choice options.
% It makes the count on the basis of entire pdf.

Modifications:
% Now it contains options with newline which were missing in my first commit
% Questions are organized in one line.
% And some printing errors in the pdf have been nullified by the code for extracting answer section.
